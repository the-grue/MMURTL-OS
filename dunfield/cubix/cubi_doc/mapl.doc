    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          MAPL is an interactive computer language, based  on  the  language
       APL, and is designed to allow the programmer to define a  library  of
       programs, which can be easily used as single operations within  other
       programs.
    
          In  order  to  provide  keyboard  symbols  for  the  many  special
       operators which are available, lower case characters are used in many
       cases as the special symbols. In order to make  it  simpler  for  the
       user, Lower case is converted to upper case, and upper case input  is
       converted to lower case, allowing the special operators to be entered
       using the SHIFT key.
    
    2. CALCULATOR MODE
    
          MAPL works by evaluating expressions, and producing results.  When
       MAPL is not running a program, it is in CALCULATOR MODE, which allows
       you to  type  in  expressions,  and  to  see  the  results.  When  in
       calculator mode, MAPL will space in five spaces from the left margin,
       and wait for a line of input. If  it  is  an  expression,  MAPL  will
       evaluate it, and display the result. NOTE: MAPL does not display  the
       result if it is  assigned  to  a  variable  in  the  last  (leftmost)
       operator of the expression.
    
          MAPL evaluates all expressions from right to left. For example, if
       you type 5*3+1 when MAPL is prompting in calculator  mode,  You  will
       get the result 20. MAPL first adds 1 to  3,  producing  4,  and  then
       multiplies that result by 5, giving  20.  Precedence  can  be  forced
       using brackets, for example, typing (5*3)+1 would give the answer 16.
    
          There are  two  types  of  values  which  may  be  entered  in  an
       expression, 16 bit integers, and characters. Integer  values  can  be
       entered using the decimal digits (0-9), the underscore  character  is
       used to indicate negative numbers. Character values are entered using
       the single quote character, "'". The single quote  character  can  be
       included in the character string by using two adjacent quotes in  the
       entered string, EG: 'DAVE''S PLACE'. Character data is represented as
       a character array, with a length equal to the number of characters in
       the entered string. Integer  values  are  represented  as  a  numeric
       array, with  a  length  equal  to  the  number  of  elements  entered
       (Separated by spaces). EG: 1 2 _3 4 5
    
    3. OPERATORS
    
          Operators are indicated by special characters, either by the ASCII
       graphic characters,such as '+' or by  LOWER  CASE  alpha  characters.
       Operators  are  the  basic  built  in  functions,  which  enable  the
       programmer to manipulate and store data. Operators  may  be  MONADIC,
       requiring one argument value which is located immediatly to the right
       of the operator, or DYADIC, requiring two argument values, which  are
       located both to the left and right of the operator symbol.
    MAPL USERS GUIDE                                                 Page: 2


          When DYADIC (two operand) operations are performed on any  values,
       the two sides must be the  same  length  (number  of  elements).  The
       operation is performed on each corresponding pair  of  elements  from
       the two arrays. For example: 1 2 3 + 4 5 6 produces the result 5 7  9
       (1+4, 2+5, 3+6). If the two values are not the same length, then  one
       of the two values must be of length one (1). If  this  is  the  case,
       then its value is automaticaly extended to match  the  other  operand
       value. For example: 2 + 4 5 6 is equivalent to 2 2 2 +  4  5  6,  and
       yields the answer 6 7 8.
    
    4. USER VARIABLES
    
          User variables are denoted by a name consisting of the  characters
       from (@, A-Z), which may be up to 31 characters long.
    
          The value produced by an expression can be assigned  to  variable,
       using the '=' assignment operator. For example ABC = 4 5 6 +  1  2  3
       would assign the result (5 7 9) to the variable ABC. When assigned  a
       value in this manner,  the  variable  assumes  the  type,  size,  and
       content of the expression to the right of the '=' operator.
    
    5. SYSTEM VARIABLES
    
          System variables consist of a single character, and are denoted by
       a trailing DOLLAR SIGN character. EG: 'O$'. System variables are used
       in expressions exactly the same way as user variables  are,  but  the
       data saved/read from the variable is not stored in  memory  as  data,
       but is used to set/interrogate system parameters, or to interface  to
       entities external to the function definition or the MAPL system.
    
          The following system  variables  are  implemented,  the  variables
       flagged with '*' can only be read, and may not be assigned a value.
    
         B$ - Buffer size. This variable contains the amount of space  which
              is reserved by MAPL  when  evaluating  an  expression.  It  is
              initially set to 1024 in a clear  workspace.  This  is  enough
              space to deal character strings of 1021 characters, or numeric
              arrays of 510 elements. If assigned a  value,  sets  the  work
              buffer size. The amount of space required for  character  data
              is 3 + the number of characters in the data. For integer data,
              it is 3 + twice the number of  elements  in  the  array.  This
              system variable affects the allocation  and  release  of  work
              buffers as expressions are nested, and should not be set  from
              anything but a simple highest level expression.
    
         C$ - Character string. This variable  returns  a  character  string
              which is 256 characters in length, and contains the characters
              with the byte value from 0 to 255. When assigned a  value,  it
              acts as a local dump, discarding the assigned value.
    
         F$ - Formatted terminal I/O. This variable  waits  for  a  line  of
              input from the terminal, and returns it as a character string.
              No prompt is displayed. If it is assigned a value,  the  value
              is displayed on the  terminal  WITHOUT  a  line-feed  carriage
              return at the end.
    
       * K$ - Key Input, Reads a single keystroke from the keyboard.
    MAPL USERS GUIDE                                                 Page: 3


         L$ - Line Number. This variable returns  the  number  of  the  line
              which is being interpreted in the function definition which is
              being executed. When assigned a value, causes a  jump  to  the
              indicated line AFTER the current expression has completed.  If
              the assigned line number is greater then the number  of  lines
              in the function, causes the  function  to  terminate.  If  the
              assigned line number is zero, causes NO jump to be taken, even
              if L$ has been assigned previously in the expression.  If  the
              assigned value is  zero  in  length,  has  no  effect  of  the
              previous state of L$.
    
         O$ - Origin value. This variable contains the system origin  value.
              The origin value is the  value  at  which  indexes  start.  It
              controls the starting element number for indexed array access,
              and also the output offsets for some system variables such  as
              '?', and 'i'. It is  normally  set  to  one  (1)  in  a  clear
              workspace.
    
       * P$ - Parameter value.  This  variable  returns  the  value  of  the
              argument value to the currently executing function definition.
              If the function was not given an argument, then P$ will return
              a zero length numeric array.
    
       * R$ - Remainder. This system  variable  will  return  the  remainder
              which was generated in the last division operation.
    
         S$ - Seed. This variable reads/sets the random  seed  used  by  the
              ROLL ('?') operator.
    
         T$ - Terminal I/O. When this variable is read, MAPL prompts with  a
              '?' at the  terminal,  and  waits  for  an  expression  to  be
              entered. The expression is then evaluated, and the  result  is
              returned. When T$ is assigned a value, the value is  displayed
              on the terminal, followed  by  a  line-feed,  carriage  return
              pair.
    
       * W$ - Returns the amount of memory which is  free  (unused)  in  the
              current workspace.

    6. USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS
    
          User definitions or programs are collections of expressions  which
       are assigned a  name.  The  definition  can  be  executed  simply  by
       refering to it's name within  another  expression.  Definition  names
       names may consist of the characters from (@, A-Z), and may be  up  to
       31 characters  in  length.  When  used  within  an  expression,  User
       definitions behave like monadic operators, accepting one  value,  and
       returning one value, It is not required that a value be passed  to  a
       definition, in which case it will receive a zero length numeric array
       as it's passed parameter.
    
       6.1 EDITING FUNCTIONS
    
             User defined functions are created  and  edited  with  the  '$'
          character. The user types '$<name>' where name is the name of  the
          function he wants to edit. If it does not exist,  it  is  created,
          otherwise it is edited. When the function is  edited,  the  editor
          prompts with '[<n>]', where <n> is the number of  the  first  free
          (unused) line in the function.
    
             While editing a function, the following commands are available:
    
       <text>  - Replaces the text on the current line with <text>, and
                 advances to the next line.
       [<n>]   - Move to line <n>.
       [<n>$]  - Move to and display line <n>.
       [$<n>]  - Display all lines from <n> to end of function.
       [$]     - Display entire function.
       [I<n>]  - Insert lines ahead of line <n>, Prompt changes to '(n)',
                 enter a null line to leave insert mode.
       [D<n>]  - Delete line <n>.
       $       - Close function definition.
       $$      - Close function definition and lock function, locked
                 functions cannot be edited, or displayed.
    
             Editing line 0 can be used to change the name of the  function,
          If this is done, the old copy of the function will remain, and can
          be removed via the ')ERASE' command.
    
             If line 0 is changed so as to give in invalid function name,  a
          DEFN ERROR will occur when an attempt is made to exit the  editor.
          In this case, the editor  will  not  terminate,  but  will  remain
          active, at line [0] allowing the function name to be changed.
    MAPL USERS GUIDE                                                 Page: 5


             Lables can be given to function lines, and consist of  a  valid
          variable name, starting in column  1,  and  followed  by  a  colon
          (':'). Lines containing  labels  are  outdented  one  column  when
          displayed by the editor. Lables are symbol table entries, and  are
          LOCAL to a function, existing only while the function is  actually
          executing.
    
             Variables can  be  made  LOCAL  to  a  function  definition  by
          including the names in the header line (line  0),  separated  from
          the function name by semicolons. When a function is  invoked,  any
          LOCAL variables will replace any external variables  of  the  same
          name, for the duration of execution  of  the  function.  When  the
          function  exits,  the  local  variables  are  destroyed,  and  the
          external variables are restored.
    
             When a user defined function is  executed,  the  value  of  its
          parameter can be accessed via the system variable 'P$'. The  value
          returned by the function will be the value of the last  expression
          evaluated within the function. Expressions within functions  which
          do not assign the result to a variable will be printed,  the  same
          way as in calculator mode. A useful trick, is to assign the  final
          value to the system "DUMP" variable 'C$', to prevent it from being
          displayed before it is returned.

    7. MAPL OPERATORS
    
       7.1 Monadic Operators
    
             The following operators require a single argument, and  produce
          a single result. All arguments are placed to the  immediate  right
          of the operator symbol.
    
    Operator   Operator                   Description of operator.
      Name      Symbol
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
    Classify |    c    |  Produces a single element value, which is a zero(0) if
             |         | the argument value contained character information,  or
             |         | a one(1) if the argument value was numeric in content.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     Execute |    e    |  Accepts only character arguments,  and  evaluates  the
             |         | argument string as an expression, returning the result.
             |         | A zero length argument, causes no operation, and a zero
             |         | length numeric array is returned.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     Index   |    i    |  Accepts only a numeric argument of length one(1),  and
     Vector  |         | produces an assending array, starting with the value of
             |         | the system origin variable 'O$',and containing a number
             |         | of elements equal to the value of the argument. A value
             |         | of zero as an argument will generate a numeric array of
             |         | zero elements.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     Reverse |    r    |  Produces an array of the same langth as the  argument,
             |         | containing the same elements, but in the reverse order.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
      Roll   |    ?    |  Produces an array of the same length as the  argument,
             |         | containing random numbers between the value of the 'O$'
             |         | system origin variable, and the value contained in the
             |         | corresponding element of the argument.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     String  |    s    |   Produces a character array, containing the  character
             |         | representation of the numeric argument.  If  more  than
             |         | one element is present in the argument, each element is
             |         | converted to a character string and  separated  by  one
             |         | space in the output. A zero  length  numeric  argument,
             |         | Produces a zero length character result.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
      Shape  |    p    |  Produces a single integer value which is the number of
             |         | elements in the argument value.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
      Sort   |    ^    |  Produces an array of the same length as the  argument,
             |         | containing index values required to place the  argument
             |         | value in non-decending order. Ie: the first element  of
             |         | the  result  contains  the  position  of  the  smallest
             |         | element in the argument, and so forth. Each index value
             |         | for each element in the argument will occur  only  once
             |         | in the resultant index array.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     Branch  |    b    |  Causes a jump to the  line  number  indicated  by  the
             |         | operand value, AFTER this expression is executed.

       7.2 Dyadic Operators
    
             The following operators require two arguments, which occur both
          to the right and the left of the operator.
             In most cases, the arguments must be the  same  length,  except
          for the case where one operator is of length one(1), and the other
          is not. In this case, the argument of length one is  automatically
          expanded to the length  of  the  the  other  argument,  with  each
          element of the new expanded  array  equal  to  the  value  of  the
          origional element in the array.
    
    Operator   Operator                   Description of operator.
      Name      Symbol
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
      Add    |    +    |  Accepts only numeric arrays, producing an array of the
             |         | same length as the arguments, containing the sum of the
             |         | elements in the argument arrays.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
    Subtract |    -    |  Accepts only numeric arrays, producing an array of the
             |         | same length as the arguments, containing the difference
             |         | of the corresponding elements in the arguments.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
    Multiply |    x    |  Multiplys the corresponding elements of  the  argument
             |         | arrays to produce a resultant array of the same length.
             |         | Accepts numeric arrays only.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
    Division |    %    |  Divides the corresponding  elements  of  the  argument
             |         | arrays, to produce a resultant array of the same length
             |         | The remainder after  the  division  of  the  first  two

    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     Modulus |    m    |  Performs a division of the elements  of  the  argument
             |         | arrays, and produces an array of the same length, which
             |         | contains the remainder after each division. The divisor

    ---------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------
      Join   |    ;    |  Produces a single result, consisting of  all  of  the
             |         | elements from the first argument, followed by  all  of
             |         | elements from the second argument. The  two  arguments
             |         | must be of the same type.
    ---------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------
      Take   |    t    |  The first argument to this operator must be a numeric
             |         | value of length one(1).  The  result  produced  is  an
             |         | array of length  <n>,  consisting  of  the  first  <n>
             |         | elements of the second argument,where <n> is the value
             |         | of the first argument. If  <n>  is  greater  than  the
             |         | number of elements in the second argument, the  result
             |         | is padded with spaces for character values, and zero's
             |         | for numeric values.
    ---------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------
      Drop   |    d    |  Similar to 'TAKE' above, but  returns  the  remaining
             |         | elements of the second argument, after the  first  <n>
             |         | elements have been removed. If <n> equals  or  excedes
             |         | the number of elements in the second argument, then  a
             |         | zero length array is returned.
    ---------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------
      Find   |    f    |  Returns the starting position (in the first argument)
             |         | of the pattern specified by the  second  argument.  If
             |         | the pattern is not found, the number returned  is  one
             |         | higher than the highest element  index  in  the  first
             |         | argument. The index value returned is adjusted for the
             |         | the current setting of the system origin variable. O$

    Translate|    n    |  Returns an integer array, with the same length as the
             |         | right-hand argument, which contains the  index  values
             |         | into  the  left-hand  argument for  the  corresponding
             |         | elements from the right-hand argument. If  an  element
             |         | from the right hand operand does not occur in the left
             |         | hand argument, then the corresponding index value will 
             |         | be one greater than the highest valid index value  for 
             |         | the left-hand argument. Due to the way translate looks
             |         | through the left argument, it will always  return  the
             |         | highest index value for elements which occur more than
             |         | once in the left-hand argument.

      Union  |    u    |  Returns an integer array, with the same length as the
             |         | left hand argument, which contains either a zero  or a
             |         | one, indicating if the corresponding element from  the 
             |         | left-hand argument is contained within the  right-hand 
             |         | argument.

      Opsys  |    o    |  This operator  provides  an  interface  to  operating
             |         | system functions. It's usage will vary from system  to
             |         | system, but the following general syntax rules  apply:
             |         |  The left-hand operand is always a simple integer,  of

             |         | value and any length, depending on the requirements of
             |         | the selected  operating  system  function.  The  value

       7.3 Other Operators
    
             The following operators do not fit into the class of monadic or
          dyadic operators, and are described here.
    
    Operator   Operator                   Description of operator.
      Name      Symbol
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
     Travel  |    \    |  This operator takes  another  operator  as  it's  left
             |         | argument, which can be one of (+,x,&,!,|,g,l).The given
             |         | operation is performed  against  each  element  of  the
             |         | numeric array given as the right argument.  The  result
             |         | produced  is  of  length  one,  and  is  equivalent  to
             |         | separating each element of the second argument with the
             |         | specified operator. EG: +\1 2 3 is equivalent to 1+2+3,
             |         | and would produce the result 6. If a zero length  array
             |         | is given as the second argument, the result is a number
             |         | known as the IDENTITY value for that operation, and  is
             |         | the number which has no effect when used as an argument
             |         | for that operation. Ie: The identity value for addition
             |         | is ZERO, and when added to another value, produces  the
             |         | same value.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
      Nest   | ( and ) |  Brackets, allow expressions to be nested and  used  as
             |         | single values in another expression,  thereby  allowing
             |         | normal right to left precedence to be altered.
    ---------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------
      Index  | [ and ] |  Allow access to elements of an array, as determined by
             |         | the expression inside the square braces.
             |         | EG:   (ri5)[1 3]    produces the result 5 3 (if O$=1).
             |         |       ABC[1 3]=4 7  Assigns the value 4  to  the  first
             |         |                     element of the variable ABC,and the
             |         |                     value 7 to the third element.

    8. SUSPENDED FUNCTIONS
    
          If an error  condition  is  encountered  while  executing  a  user
       defined function, the execution of that function will be  terminated,
       and  an  error  message  printed,  indicating  the  type   of   error
       encountered, the name of the function being executed,  and  the  line
       number on which the error occured. In order to aid in debugging,  the
       function will actually be SUSPENDED in execution, allowing access  to
       it's symbols and local variables from calculator mode.
    
          When a function is suspended, buffer and stack space allocated  to
       that function will not be released until a ')REL' or ')RESET' command
       is issued, which will terminate the function and release  it's  local
       symbols and buffer space. This is normally done after determining the
       cause of the error.
    
          The equivalent of a ')RESET' command will be performed whenever  a
       function is edited, or any symbol is erased via the ')ERASE' command.
    
          The names of GLOBAL  variables  which  were  superceded  by  local
       variables in a suspended  function  will  still  be  visible  in  the
       ')VARS' variable list, even though they will not be accessable  until
       the suspension of the function containing local variables of the same
       name is cleared.
    
          Line labels belonging to suspended functions  will  exist  in  the
       symbol table, and can be seen with the ')LBLS' command.

    9. SYSTEM COMMANDS
    
          The following is a description of the system commands which may be
       entered while in calculator mode. System comamnds  may  not  be  used
       from within a user defined  function.  The  parameters  indicated  by
       square braces are optional.
    
       9.1 )CLEAR [<symbol table size>]
    
             Clears the workspace, setting it's  name  to  'CLEAR  WS',  and
          initializes the symbol table, erasing all variables and functions.
          The system variables are reset to their  default  values.  If  the
          optional <symbol table size> parameter is given,  then  that  many
          bytes are reserved in the workspace  for  the  symbol  table.  The
          default value for the symbol table size is 1000 bytes.
    
             Symbol table entries are required for function names,  variable
          names, and for local variables and lables in executing  functions.
          Each entry requires a number of  bytes  of  memory  equal  to  the
          number of characters in the symbol name plus  four.  Symbol  names
          can be from 1 to 31 characters in length.
    
       9.2 )CONTINUE
    
             Saves the currently loaded workspace on  the  disk,  under  the
          workspace name 'CONTINUE', and then terminates the session.
             If a workspace by the name of 'CONTINUE' exists  when  MAPL  is
          first executed, It will be automaticaly loaded.
    
       9.3 )DROP <wsname>
    
             Removes the named saved workspace from the disk.
    
       9.4 )ERASE <symbol>
    
             Removes the  named  symbol  (function  or  variable)  from  the
          workspace.
    
       9.5 )FNS
    
             Displays the names of all  user  defined  functions  which  are
          present in the currently loaded workspace.
    
       9.6 )LBLS
    
             Displays the names of all user defined  function  labels  which
          are currently in the symbol table. Function labels are only placed
          in the symbol table during execution of that function, and  should
          not be visible unless the workspace contains suspended functions.
    
       9.7 )LIB [<filespec>]
    
             Displays the names of workspaces which are saved on  the  disk.
          If the <filespec> operand is specified, it is used as a  mask  for
          the directory listing. I.E: If you  enter  ')LIB  B*',  all  saved
          workspace names which start with a 'B' would be displayed.

       9.8 )LOAD <wsname>
    
             Loads the named saved workspace from disk,  and  makes  it  the
          active workspace. When the workspace  is  loaded,  if  the  symbol
          '@LX' is found in the new workspace, it is evaluated,  and  should
          return a string value which is then executed (via 'e').
    
       9.9 )OFF
    
             Terminates the session, returning to the operating system.
    
       9.10 )REL
    
             Releases the most recently suspended function, reclaiming  it's
          stack and buffer space, and removes any  local  variables  it  may
          have had.
    
       9.11 )RESET
    
             Releases all suspended functions, reclaiming stack  and  buffer
          space, as well as removing all local  variables  from  the  symbol
          table.
    
       9.12 )SAVE [<wsname>]
    
             Saves the currently loaded workspace  on  the  disk  under  the
          given name. If no name is specified, the workspace is saved  under
          it's own name.
    
       9.13 )SI
    
             Displays a list of all functions which  are  suspended  in  the
          workspace, including the line number on which suspension  occured,
          and the names of all local variables belonging to the function.
    
       9.14 )STAT
    
             Displays information  about  the  currently  loaded  workspace,
          included in this display are symbol table size, number of symbols,
          amount of free space in symbol table, and the amount of free space
          in the workspace.
    
       9.15 )SYS [<command>]
    
             Executes the DOS command <command>. If no command is  supplied,
          enters the dos, allowing return  to  MAPL  via  the  DOS  'RETURN'
          command.

    10. COMMENTS
    
          Any line which begins with  an  asterix  ('*')  is  treated  as  a
       comment, and is ignored by the interpreter.
    
    11. KEYBOARD INTERRUPTS
    
          The CONTROL-C character can be used to interrupt MAPL  in  several
       ways.
    
       1) If a user defined function is executing, typing a  CONTROL-C  will
          interrupt the execution of that function, causing a suspension.
    
       2) If a CONTROL-C is entered while editing  a  function,  the  editor
          will be aborted, and any changes which were made will be lost.
    
       3) If a CONTROL-C is entered in response to a 'T$'  of  'F$'  prompt,
          the input request will be canceled, and any functions  which  were
          in a state of execution will be suspended.

    12. ERROR MESSAGES
    
          The following error message are produced by the interpreter.
    
       12.1 DEFN ERROR
    
             Results from an attempt to edit a function name  which  is  not
          editable, either because it is locked, is an invalid name, or that
          name is already in use for a variable. Also results when exiting a
          function after the name has been  made  invalid,  or  from  errors
          during editing.
    
       12.2 DOMAIN ERROR
    
             Results from an attempt to perform  an  operation  on  a  value
          which is not in the domain of the function being used, such as  an
          argument to a function which  is  the  wrong  type  (character  or
          numeric) for that function, or for the other argument in a  dyadic
          function.
             This error also results from any error inside of a locked  user
          defined function.
    
       12.3 INDEX ERROR
    
             Results from an attempt to index a value  with  a  index  value
          which falls outside of the range of valid  index  values  for  the
          first value.
    
       12.4 LENGTH ERROR
    
             Results from use of a value which is not of a  length  required
          for use by a particular function.  Also  results  from  use  of  a
          dyadic function on values which are of incompatable lengths.
    
       12.5 SYNTAX ERROR
    
             Results from any statement which does  not  follow  the  syntax
          rules.
    
       12.6 SYSTEM ERROR
    
             Results from an internal error  condition,  which  can  not  be
          accounted for. A series of HEX values will be dumped out following
          the error, which contains valuable information about  the  current
          state of the system at the time the error was detected. Write  the
          values down, and include them with a bug  report  if  the  problem
          persists.
    
       12.7 VALUE ERROR
    
             Results from an attempt to use a symbol that has no value.  Any
          reference to an undefined  symbol  other  an  an  assignment  will
          result in this error.

    14. APPENDIX 2 - Internal Data Storage Format
    
          When data is  assigned  to  a  variable,  or  simply  used  in  an
       expression, it converted to a standard internal data  structure.  The
       format of this structure is as follows:
    
                    [Type field]    (1 Byte)
                    [Length field]  (2 bytes)
                    [Data field]    (Variable length)
    
          The type field consists  of  a  single  byte,  and  indicates  the
       classification of the content of the structure.  Currently  the  only
       values used for the type byte are 0 for character information, and  1
       for integer information.
    
          The Length field contains a 16  bit  number  indicating  how  many
       elements are in the structure.
    
          The data field  contains  the  actual  data  elements,  stored  in
       REVERSE order. For character data, the elements are  one  byte  each,
       and for integer data, the elements are two bytes in size.

    15. APPENDIX 3 - The OPSYS Function.
          The  OPSYS  ('o')  function  provides  an  interface  to  specific
       operating system functions, which may vary depending on the operating
       system used. Care should be taken when writing definitions which  use
       this operator, as they may not be transportable to other systems.
    
          The  OPSYS  function  supplied  with  CUBIX  has   the   following
       functions:
    
     Function Right Hand  -     Description
       Code    Operator
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        0   | Character  |  Passes the operand string to the DOS, to be executed
            |            | as a DOS command. Returns a standard DOS return code.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        1   | Character  |  Opens the file indicated by the operand for a serial
            |            | READ operation.  Returns a  file control block  (FCB)
            |            | which is an integer array of length 261 if successful
            |            | or a standard dos return code (length 1) if failure.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        2   | Character  |  Opens the file indicated by the operand for a serial
            |            | WRITE operation. Returns a  file control block  (FCB)
            |            | if successful, or a standard return code if failure.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        3   | Character  |  Tests for existance of a file, returns standard DOS
            |            | return code value.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        4   |  Integer   |  Reads data from main memory.  A byte  of  memory  is
            |            | fetched at the address contained in each  element  of
            |            | the operand. An integer array is returned.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        5   |  Integer   |  Writes data to main memory. The first element of the
            |            | operand is taken as the address, and the value of all
            |            | following elements are written sequentially as data.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
        6   |  Integer   |  Executes a System Service Request  (SSR).  The  five
            |            | element operand has the following format:
            |            |        (SSR  NUMBER), (A&B), (X), (Y), (U)
            |            |  After executing the  system  request, the  following
            |            | five element array is returned:
            |            |        (RETURN CODE), (A&B), (X), (Y), (U)
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
       FCB  | Character  |  Writes the operand data to the file indicated by the
            |            | supplied FCB variable. This function updates the FCB,
            |            | and therefore it must be given as a simple  variable,
            |            | not contained in an expression or within brackets.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
       FCB  |      0     |  Reads a line from the open file, and returns a char-
            |            | acter string if successful, Integer  return  code  if
            |            | not. See above for restriction of FCB specification.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
       FCB  |      1     |  Closes the file indicated by FCB.  Returns  standard
            |            | DOS return code. See above for restriction of FCB.
    --------+------------+------------------------------------------------------
       FCB  |      2     |  Rewinds the indicated file. Returns DOS return code.
            |            | See above for restriction of FCB specification.
