    DO          -   Begins a DO loop construct, using a beginning
                    counter value of TOS, and an ending value of TOS-1
    LOOP        -   Increments the counter, and jumps back to the
                    beginning of the code following 'DO' if it does not
                    match the ending value specified to the 'DO'

    +LOOP       -   Adds TOS to the counter and jumps back to the
                    beginning of the code following 'DO' if it does

> Misc. Operators

    EXEC        -   Begin execution at address in TOS.
    ' <word>    -   Push the address of the following word.

    >R          -   Push TOS on the return stack
    <R          -   Pop the top of the return stack and push
                    value on the data stack.
    RP!         -   Reset the return stack. Note, after using
                    this operator, a word may not return to its
                    calling word, but must use the 'QUIT' word
                    to terminate.

> Dictionary Manipulation Operators

    VLIST       -   Display names of all defined words
    FORGET <word>
                -   Remove the named word and all subsequently
                    defined words from the dictionary.
    CREATE <name>
                -   Create an entry for the named word in the
                    dictionary. The word defintion points to
                    first free memory address at the end of
                    the dictionary.
    ALLOT       -   Allocate TOS bytes of free space at the end
                    of the dictionary.
    VARIABLE <name>
                -   Defines a variable with the indicated name.
                    Execution of the name will place on the stack
                    the address of the variable (1 word). The variable
                    may then be read or set using the '@' and '!'
                    operators or their variants.
    " string"   -   Compilies the operand string at the end of the
                    dictionary. At execution time, the address of the
                    string will be placed on TOS, and a jump around
                    the string executed.
    : <name>    -   Begins defintion of a new word which will
                    be created with the indicated name. All following
                    words up to a ';' will be compiled into the
                    word, and will be executed sequentially when the
                    word is invoked.
    ;           -   Ends definition of a new word.
    [CR]        -   Compile a return instruction at the end of the
                    dictionary (in the word currently being defined).
    [CL]        -   Compile the value of TOS as a literal value at the
                    end of the dictionary (in the word currently being
                    defined).
    [CW]        -   Compile a call to the word address in TOS at the end
                    of the dictionary (in the word currently being
                    defined).
    [C1]        -   Compile a single byte value TOS at the end of the
                    dictionary (in the word currently being defined).
    [C2]        -   Compile a word value TOS at the end of the dictionary
                    (In the word currently being defined).
    [EC]        -   Causes last (or currently) defined word to be set
                    to execute during compilation. This will cause the
                    word to be executed whenever it is used in a ':'
                    definition, rather than being compiled into the new
                    word defintion. This allows the word to "become"
                    part of the compiler, and "build" its own entries
                    into the new words defintion.
    [FC] <word> -   Force compilation of a call to the next word, even
                    if it is normally executed during compilation.
    [NI]        -   Causes last (or currently) defined word to be set
                    to non-interactive. This causes an error message to
                    be issued if the word is executed from the keyboard,
                    allowing it only to be used during the compilation
                    of other words. This is particularly useful when the
                    word in question builds onto the definition of a word
                    under compilation, and therefore could corrupt the
                    dictionary is used outside of the context of a
                    compilation.
    [NC]        -   Causes last (or currently) defined word to be set to
                    be non-compiling. This causes an error message to
                    be issued if an attempt is made to use this word in
                    the compilation of a new word.
    EXEC>       -   Compiles a jump to the remainder of this word at the
                    end of the dictionary (in the word currently being
                    compiled). This allows a word to perform some
                    dictionary building at compile time, and then
                    to perform some other operations at run time.
