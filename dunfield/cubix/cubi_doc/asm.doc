    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          The assembler, is a multi-pass assembler, which produces code  for
       the Motorola 6809 microprocessor,  and  runs  under  the  CUBIX  Disk
       Operating System on the 6809. It  accepts  a  input  file  containing
       assembly source  statements,  and  generates  both  an  object  file,
       containing machine instructions, and a  listing  file,  containing  a
       printed list of the code generated.
    
    2. ASSEMBLER SOURCE INPUT
    
       2.1 Source File Format
    
             The  assembler  accepts  a  source  file,  containing  assembly
          statements, one per line. Lines beginning with an asterisk  ('*'),
          are treated as comments, and are ignored  by  the  assembler.  All
          other lines have the following format:
    
        <label field>  <opcode field>  <operand field>  <comment field>
    
             A description of the individual fields follows:
    
    
          <label field>
    
             This field must start at column one, and contains the label for
          this line. The label will be  entered  in  the  assemblers  SYMBOL
          TABLE, such that the address of the instruction on this  line  can
          be referenced by this label. If the character in column one  is  a
          blank or a tab, then the assembler will ignore  the  label  field,
          and no symbol table entry will be made for this address.
    
          <opcode field>
    
             This field  occurs  immediately  after  the  label  field,  and
          contains the symbolic 6809 opcode or assembler directive  that  is
          to be processed for this line. The opcode field is separated  from
          the label field by a number of spaces or tabs.
    
          <operand field>
    
             This field occurs  immediately  after  the  opcode  field,  and
          contains the operands to the 6809 opcode  or  assembler  directive
          which was specified in the  opcode  field.  If  no  operands  were
          required, then the opcode field is ignored by the  assembler,  and
          is treated as part of the comment  field.  The  operand  field  is
          separated from the opcode field by a number of spaces or tabs.
    
          <comment field>
    
             This field occurs immediately after the operand field,  and  is
          ignored by the assembler, but reproduced in the listing  file.  It
          extends to the end of the source line, and is separated  from  the
          operand field by tabs or spaces.

       2.2 Expressions
    
             When an 8 or 16 bit value is  required  as  an  operand  to  an
          assembler directive or an instruction, either a simple  value,  or
          an expression consisting of simple values  and  operators  may  be
          used. All expressions are evaluated using 16 bit values. When used
          for  an  eight  bit  result,  the  lower  eight  bits  are   used.
          Expressions are evaluated from left to right, as each operator  is
          encountered, with no precedence. Spaces or tabs  are  not  allowed
          within an expression, unless they are contained within a character
          string.
    
             The following operators may be used in an expression:
    
       2.2.1 Unary (one operand) operators:
       
             -  - Negation, returns the negative of the next value.
             ~  - Complement, returns one's complement of the value.
             =  - Swaps the high and low bytes of the next value.
       
       2.2.2 Binary (two operand) operators:
       
             +  - Addition.
             -  - Subtraction.
             *  - Multiplication.
             /  - Division.
             \  - Modulus, returns remainder after division.
             &  - Bitwise logical AND.
             |  - Bitwise logical OR.
             ^  - Bitwise exclusive OR.
       
       2.2.3 Values in expressions
       
             The following forms of simple values may be used.
       
             nnn     -  Decimal number, eg: 21
             $hhh    -  Hexidecimal number, eg: $15
             %bbb    -  Binary number, eg: %10101
             @ooo    -  Octal number, eg: @177
             'cc'    -  ASCII character data.
             <label> -  Value of a label from symbol table.
             *       -  Value of current program counter.
    6809 ASSEMBLER                                                   Page: 3


       2.3 Addressing modes
    
             The assembler supports all of the 6809's addressing modes,  and
          will  determine  from  the  operands  to  an   instruction   which
          addressing mode is to be used. If register  offset  addressing  is
          used, then the assembler will determine the most efficient  offset
          size (5 bit, 8 bit or 16 bit).
    
             If the operand is preceded by a  pound  sign  ('#'),  then  the
          assembler will use immediate addressing mode, and code  the  value
          of  the  expression  as  the  immediate  data.  Note  that  if  an
          instruction only requires eight bits of immediate data, (eg. CMPA)
          then only the LOWER eight bits of the  expression  value  will  be
          used. The high eight bits can be accessed by preceding  the  value
          with '=' (Swapping the high and low bytes).
    
             If the operand is preceded by a left angle bracket ('<'),  then
          direct page addressing will be used.  Note  that  only  the  lower
          eight bits if the expression value will be used,  and  it  is  the
          responsibility of the programmer to insure that the direct page is
          set correctly.
    
             If the operand is preceded by a right angle bracket  ('>'),  or
          if no other addressing mode applies, then extended addressing will
          be used.
    
             If the operand in enclosed in square braces ('[' &  ']'),  then
          the indirect form of that particular addressing mode will be used.

    3. ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES
    
          The following assembler directives are implemented:
    
    
       ORG <expression>
    
          Sets the current assembly program counter  to  the  value  of  the
       operand expression. This causes all subsequent code (up to next  ORG)
       to be generated to run at that address.
    
       <label> EQU <expression>
    
          Creates the  symbol  <label>,  and  gives  it  the  value  of  the
       expression.
    
       FCB <expression>[,<expression,...]
    
          Generates eight bit  data  bytes  containing  the  values  of  the
       expressions.
    
       FDB <expression>[,<expression>,...]
    
          Generates sixteen bit data words  containing  the  values  of  the
       expressions.
    
       RMB <expression>
    
          Reserves a number of bytes of memory equal to  the  value  of  the
       expression. The contents of the reserved bytes will be undefined.
    
       FCC "<string>"
    
          Generates an ASCII string, the delimiter  characters  may  be  any
       character which is not part of the string.
    
       FCCZ "<string>"
    
          Operates the  same  as  'FCC'  except  that  the  string  will  be
       terminated with a zero byte.
    
       SSR <expression>
    
          Generates an SYSTEM SERVICE REQUEST to the operating system.
    
       PAGE
    
          Forces a page skip in the listing.
    
       TITLE <text>
    
          Sets the page title to the text contained in the remainder of  the
       line.
    6809 ASSEMBLER                                                   Page: 6


       SETDP <expression>
    
          Sets the assemblers default direct page register to the eight  bit
       value of <expression>. Whenever a  reference  is  made  to  a  memory
       location by address, without a specific  addressing  mode  specified,
       the assembler will use extended addressing, unless the high  byte  of
       the address matches the value of the default direct page register. If
       this occurs, the assembler will use direct page addressing. It is the
       responsibility of the programmer to insure that the 6809 direct  page
       register will contain  the  proper  value  during  memory  references
       subsequent to a 'SETDP' directive. If the value  of  <expression>  is
       greater than 255, or less than zero, the default direct page register
       will be disabled, and all  unspecified  memory  references  will  use
       extended addressing. This is the default mode at the beginning of  an
       assembly.
    
       Note: The upper eight bits of a label's value can be accessed  as  an
       eight bit value by dividing the lable by 256.
    
                           EG:  ' SETDP  LABLE/256 '

    4. ERROR MESSAGES
    
          When the assembler detects an  error  in  the  assembly,  it  will
       generate a message in the listing indicating what type of  error  has
       occured. This will occur on the line following the error, or  at  the
       top of the listing if the error was generated in the  first  assembly
       pass. The error message also contains an error number  which  may  be
       used to reference the following summary of error messages.
    
    Message#                       Message and description.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        0   |               Duplicate symbol: <symbol name>
            |   The indicated symbol is defined more that once within  this
            | assembly.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        1   |                 Unknown opcode or directive
            |   The instruction  field  on  the  indicated  line  does  not
            | contain a valid 6809 instruction or assembler directive.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        2   |                     Address out of range
            |   A short branch instruction on the  indicated  line  has  an
            | operand indicating a address which is more than  +127 or -128
            | bytes away from the current program counter address.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        3   |                   Invalid addressing mode
            |   The addressing mode indicated by the operand field  of  the
            ! indicated line does not apply to the instruction on that line.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        4   !                Invalid register specification
            !   The instruction on the indicated line specifies a  register
            ! which is not a valid 6809 register, or cannot be used  in the
            ! context specified by the instruction.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        5   !                      Undefined symbol
            !   A symbol referenced in the indicated line  is  not  defined
            ! anywhere within this assembly, and has no value.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        6   !                Invalid expression syntax
            !   The expression on the indicated line contains  a  character
            ! which is not recognized as a valid operator. 
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        7   !                  Invalid argument format
            !   The indicated line has an operand which is  not  in  proper
            ! format.
    --------+--------------------------------------------------------------
        8   |                 Improperly delimited string
            !   A character string constant on the indicated line does  not
            ! have a proper closing delimiter. This is normally the  single
            ! quote character, but may be another character in  conjunction
            ! with the FCC or FCCZ directives.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. QUALIFIERS
    
          The following qualifiers are accepted by the 'ASM' command:
    
       /ERROR
    
          When this qualifier is specified, the assembler will  only  output
       lines to the listing file if they contained an error.
    
       /FAST
    
          When this qualifier is specified, the assembler will  not  perform
       optimization passes. All offsets are  assumed  to  be  16  bits,  All
       non-specified  memory  references  will   be   done   with   extended
       addressing, and forward references  in  equate  statements  will  not
       work. The code generated will be inefficient, but the assembler  will
       run quite a bit  faster.  This  qualifier  is  useful  when  you  are
       initialy testing and debugging a program.
          NOTE: Address out or range error's occuring  with  this  qualifier
       may be a result of larger code produced, and may assemble ok  without
       this qualifier.
    
       /QUIET
    
          Prevents the assembler from displaying informational  messages  on
       the terminal, as it performs each step of the assembly.
    
       /SYMBOL
    
          This qualifier causes the assembler to display the symbol table at
       the end of the listing. If the /TERM qualifier is also specified, the
       symbol table display will be  formatted  for  an  80  column  display
       instead of 132.
    
       /TERM
    
          This qualifier causes the assembler to output the listing  to  the
       terminal instead of to a file.
    
          All of the above qualifiers may be abbreviated to a mimimum of one
       character (Excluding the slash).
    
                            EG:    ASM/F/E/T PROGRAM
    6809 ASSEMBLER                                                   Page: 9


    6. IMAGE BUILDING UTILITY
    
          The output from the assembler  is  an  intermediate  object  file,
       which must be converted to a format suitable  for  loading.  This  is
       done by the BUILD program. A linker  is  planned,  which  will  allow
       several object files to be linked together into one image,  but  this
       is not yet implemented.
    
          The BUILD command will accept the qualifier '/MHX' which causes it
       to generate a Motorola Hex  format  download  file  (suffix  '.MHX'),
       instead of an executable load image (suffix '.EXE').
    
          Unless the '/KEEP' qualifier is given to BUILD, it will delete the
       intermediate (suffix '.OBJ') file produced by the assembler before it
       writes the image file.
    
          The  '/QUIET'  qualifier  may  be  used  to  prefent  BUILD   from
       displaying statistics on the created load image, and the name of  the
       output file.
    
    7. USING THE ASSEMBLER
    
          The assembler source input file must be entered into a file with a
       type of '.ASM'. Once this is done, enter the command:
    
                                 ASM <filename>
    
       where <filename> is the name of the input file. Do  not  include  the
       '.ASM' suffix as part of the filename.
    
          If there were any errors  in  the  assembly,  the  assembler  will
       display a message indicating how many error occured, and return  with
       a return code value of 100. if there were no  errors,  the  assembler
       will return a return code of 0 (success).
    
          The  assembler  will  produce  a  <filename>.OBJ  file  with   the
       intermediate object code, and a <filename>.LST file with the listing.
    
          When the program assembles without errors, generate  a  executable
       image with the command:
    
                                BUILD <filename>
    
       This will read the <filename>.OBJ file, and generate a <filename>.EXE
       file which can be run with the command:
    
                                 RUN <filename>

       7.1 Null Filename
    
             If no filenames are given to the ASM and BUILD  programs,  they
          will assume a null filename. The assembler will  look  for  '.ASM'
          and generate '.OBJ' and '.LST'. The BUILD program will read '.OBJ'
          and generate '.EXE' or '.MHX'.  The  dos  RUN  command  will  also
          assume a null filename, and will attempt to execute a file  called
          '.EXE' if no filename is given to it.
    
             The above behaviour can be used to simplify the steps  required
          to assemble a program. This  is  particularly  useful  during  the
          development stage when a program may need to be assembled a number
          of times.
    
             To do this, simply copy your progam into a file called  '.ASM'.
          Now all you need to type to assemble it is 'ASM', to generate  the
          image, just type 'BUILD', and to run the program, just type 'RUN'.
    
       7.2 Performance
    
             Although the assembler  is  capable  of  resolving  first  pass
          forward references, many occurences of the  above  can  cause  the
          assembler to operate much slower than it normally would. Below  is
          a list of things to avoid when performing large assemblies:
    
             Forward referenced symbols as offsets.
    
             Forward referenced symbols in EQUate statements.
    
             Direct page addressing  to  forward  referenced  symbols  using
          implied direct page addresing (SETDP).
