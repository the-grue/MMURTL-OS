    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          The  TTY  interface  routines  provide  a  set  of  functions  for
       accessing the terminal screen which make use of an internal table  to
       determine the  actual  codes  sent  and  received  to  and  from  the
       terminal.
    
          A separate utility program "TTYPATCH" is  provided  which  updates
       that internal table, allowing the terminal control codes and function
       keys to be modified in the programs  executable  image  ".EXE"  file.
       This allows screen oriented programs such as the "EDT" editor  to  be
       customized by the user to operate on virtually any terminal.
    
          The assembler source for the "TTY" interface routines is  provided
       on the CUBIX distribution diskette in the  file  "[EXAMPLES]TTY.ASM",
       and should be included in any programs makeing use of this interface.
    
    2. TTY INTERFACE ROUTINES
    
          The following subroutines comprise the TTY interface:
    
       2.1 ENTRY
    
             The "ENTRY" routine is not actually a subroutine, but  must  be
          included as the absolute first code to occur in the  ".EXE"  file.
          It serves two  purposes:  First,  it  outputs  the  initialization
          string to the terminal to set up operating modes  and/or  function
          keys,  Second,  the  "TTYPATCH"  utility  keys  on  this  code  to
          determine if this program uses the "TTY" interface, and the actual
          address of the terminal independance  tables  located  within  the
          image.
    
       2.2 PUTCHR
    
             This routine outputs  the  character  in  'A'  to  the  console
          terminal. If the  character  is  in  the  range  of  normal  ASCII
          characters ($00 to $7F), it  is  output  to  the  console  without
          translation.
    
             If the character output is greater than $7F (Has the  high  bit
          set), the  following  operation  is  performed  by  outputing  the
          appropriate codes to the terminal:
    
             $80 - Clear terminal screen
             $81 - Clear from cursor to end of line
             $82 - Clear from cursor to end of screen
             $83 - Turn on special video mode (reverse etc..)
             $84 - Turn off special video mode
             $85 - Scroll the screen forward one line

       2.3 GOTOXY
    
             This routine positions  the  cursor  on  the  terminal  to  the
          indicated X/Y position passed in 'A' (X = 0 - 79), and  'B'  (Y  =
          0-23).
    
       2.4 GETKEY
    
             This routine gets a single character from the console terminal.
          Special code sequences representing  function  keys  are  trapped,
          decoded, and returned as a single character  of  a  value  greater
          than $7F (High bit set), with the following meaning:
    
             $80 - Up arrow
             $81 - Down arrow
             $82 - Right arrow
             $83 - Left arrow
             $84 - Page up
             $85 - Page down
             $86 - Page right
             $87 - Page left
             $88 - Home
             $89 - End
             $8A - Delete character under cursor
             $8B - Delete previous character
             $8C - Clear screen key
             $8D - Function key 1
             $8E - Function key 2
             $8F - Function key 3
             $90 - Function key 4
             $91 - Function key 5
             $92 - Function key 6
             $93 - Function key 7
             $94 - Function key 8
             $95 - Function key 9
             $96 - Function key 10
             $97 - Function key 11
             $98 - Function key 12
             $99 - Function key 13
             $9A - Function key 14
             $9B - Function key 15

    3. THE TTYPATCH UTILITY
    
          The TTYPATCH provides a method of modifying an application program
       which uses the "TTY" interface  to  customize  it  for  a  particular
       terminal.
    
          TTYPATCH does not itself use the TTY interface, but operates using
       a  line  by  line  menu  system.  This  allows  configuration  for  a
       particular console terminal when  no  defintions  for  that  terminal
       previously exist.
    
          Once TTYPATCH is invoked, it will display the following menu:
    
          1 - Standard key definitions
          2 - Function key definitions
          3 - Control code definitions
          4 - Load settings from program
          5 - Save settings to program
          6 - Exit TTYPATCH utility
    
          If you are defining  a  terminal  for  the  first  time,  you  may
       immediatly begin entering key/code definitions using the options  (1,
       2, and 3) of the menu.
    
          If you wish to  modify  the  terminal  interface  of  an  existing
       program, you should first select option (4), and enter  the  name  of
       the programs executable (".EXE") file at the "Filename?" prompt. This
       will load the key and function code settings with  the  values  which
       are currently defined in that program.
    
          Once modifications are complete, you should select option  (5)  to
       write the  new  settings  to  the  file.  Enter  the  names  programs
       executable file at the "Filename?" prompt. If you wish to define  the
       same terminal interface for several programs, you may use option  (5)
       to write the settings to each one in turn.
    
          Note that simply reading (Option 4), and then writing  (Option  5)
       to a different program file provides a method of copying the settings
       from one program to another.

       3.1 Entering definitions
    
             The first three items of the main menu allow you to display and
          change the key and control codes used by the terminal interface.
    
             WARNING: Do to the the way the GETKEY  function  traverses  the
          table for  the  input  keys  (Options  1  and  2),  it  will  stop
          processing if it encounters a NULL key definition,  and  any  keys
          defined  past  that  definition  will  be   unavailable   to   the
          application program. In other words,  ALL  standard  and  function
          keys MUST be defined.
    
             Option (1), "Standard key definitions"  defines  the  following
          keys which should be common to all screen oriented applications.
    
             A - Cursor up
             B - Cursor down
             C - Cursor right
             D - Cursor left
             E - Page up
             F - Page down
             G - Page right
             H - Page left
             I - Home
             J - End
             K - Delete character
             L - Delete previous
             M - Clear screen
    
             CURSOR UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT should be defined to the codes
          generated by the "arrow" keys on the terminal.
    
             PAGE UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT are provided for movement between
          screens and/or fields on the screen.
    
             HOME and END are provided for rapid access  to  the  first  and
          last data entry fields within an application.
    
             DELETE CHARACTER is intended to  represent  a  key  which  will
          delete the character under the cursor without moving it.
    
             DELETE PREVIOUS represents a key which will backup the  cursor,
          and then delete the character under it,  in  effect  removing  the
          last character entered.
    
             CLEAR  SCREEN  is  used  to  refresh   the   terminal   screen,
          re-displaying all infromation.

             Option (2), "Function  key  definitions"  defines  15  function
          keys,  which  are  available   for   application   dependant   key
          requirements.
    
             Option (3), "Control code definitions" defines the output codes
          which are sent to the terminal to perform specific functions.
    
             A - Terminal initialization
             B - Cursor positioning
             C - Clear screen
             D - Clear to end of line
             E - Clear to end of screen
             F - Special effect ON
             G - Special effect OFF
             H - Scroll screen forward
    
             TERMINAL INITIALIZATION is  a  string  which  is  sent  to  the
          terminal when the application is first invoked. It is used to  set
          up function keys and or terminal modes.
    
             CURSOR POSITIONING is the string which is sent to the  terminal
          to position the cursor.
    
             CLEAR SCREEN is a string which is sent to  clear  the  terminal
          screen.
    
             CLEAR TO END OF LINE is a string which is sent  to  clear  from
          the cursor position to the end of the line.
    
             CLEAR TO END OF SCREEN is a string which is sent to clear  from
          the cursor position to the end of the screen.
    
             SPECIAL EFFECT ON is a string which is sent to enable a special
          video mode. REVERSE VIDEO is the preferred special mode if  it  is
          available.
    
             SPECIAL EFFECT OFF is a string  which  turns  off  the  special
          video mode and returns to normal output.
    
             SCROLL SCREEN FORWARD is a string which causes the the terminal
          to shift the display up one line. For most terminals  this  string
          should position the cursor at the bottom left hand corner  of  the
          display, and issue a LINE FEED character.

             To enter a new value for a particular string from the sub-menu,
          press its corresponding letter. Entering a CARRIAGE RETURN at  the
          sub-menu prompt will return you to the main menu.
    
             When entering a string, pressing the CARRIAGE-RETURN  key  will
          cause a prompt for an action to take, which is entered as a single
          character. The available options are:
    
             (D)elete - This option  causes  TTYPATCH  to  delete  the  last
          character entered, re-display the input line, and continue input.
    
             (C)ontinue - This option simply re-displays the input line  and
          continues input.
    
             (E)nter-CR - This option causes the carriage  return  character
          (^M) to be entered into the input line, and continues input.
    
             (H)exchar - This option must be  followed  by  two  hexidecimal
          characters (0-9, A-F), after which  a  character  of  that  binary
          value till be entered into the input line.
    
             (Q)uit - This option  terminates  input,  and  returns  to  the
          sub-menu, allowing you to pick another function.
    
             (X) - During entry of CURSOR POSITIONING, use  of  this  option
          causes the desired 'X' (horizontal) position  to  be  inserted  at
          this position in  the  output  string.  Following  this  selection
          TTYPATCH prompts  for  (B)inary  or  (D)ecimal  output.  Selecting
          Binary causes the position to be output as a single character with
          the 'X' value. Selecting Decimal causes the position to be  output
          as a ASCII encoded decimal string. TTYPATCH then prompts  for  the
          OFFSET value, entered two hexidecimal digits. The OFFSET value  is
          added to the 'X' value before it is output.
    
             (Y) - During entry of CURSOR POSITIONING, use  of  this  option
          causes the desired 'Y' (vertical) position to be inserted at  this
          position in the output string. Following prompts are the  same  as
          for (X).
    
    The TTY interface                                                Page: 7


             For example, a VT100 terminal expects the 'X' and 'Y' positions
          to be output as ASCII encoded decimal with a  value  beginning  at
          '1'. The format of the cursor positioning string is  "<ESC>[Y;XH".
          You would enter this string as: (Note <ESC> displays as '^[')
    
            ^[[                     (Carriage return Y)
            (B)inary (D)ecimal? D
            Offset value (hex)? 01
            ^[[<YD01>;              (Carriage return X)
            (B)inary (D)ecimal? D
            Offset value (hex)? 01
            ^[[<YD01>;<XD01>H       (Carriage return Q)
    
             A VC4404 Terminal expects 'X' and 'Y' position to be output  as
          printable characters with a value  beginning  with  a  space.  The
          format of the cursor positioning string is "^PYX". You would enter
          this string as:
    
            ^P                      (Carriage return Y)
            (B)inary (D)ecimal? B
            Offset value (hex)? 20
            ^P<YB20>                (Carriage return X)
            (B)inary (D)ecimal? B
            Offset value (hex)? 20
            ^P<YB20><XB20>          (Carriage return Q)

    4. SAMPLE DEFINITIONS
    
          The [EXAMPLES] directory of your  distribution  diskette  contains
       sample defintions for a VT100 and VC4404 terminals which  are  placed
       in small "STUB" files called "VT100.TTY" and "VC4404.TTY".
    
          These samples may be examined  or  copied  to  a  screen  oriented
       application (such as the "EDT" editor) using "TTYPATCH".
    
          In both defintions, the cursor keys are  mapped  to  the  terminal
       arrow keys. Other key definitions are as follows:
    
       4.1 VT100
    
             The VT100 defintion makes use of the alternate keypad  mode  of
          the terminal, and defines the keys a follows:
    
              "TTY Definition"                "EDT Editor usage"

       4.2 VC4404
    
             The VC4404 defintion makes use of  the  function  keys  of  the
