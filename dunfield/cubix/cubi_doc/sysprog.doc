    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          This document describes the internal operation of the  CUBIX  disk
       operating  system,  and  the  facilities  available  to   application
       programs and utilities.
    
          Detailed discriptions are provided for the  disk,  directory,  and
       sector link map formats, as well as descriptions  of  the  appliction
       program interface, and the functions which are available through it.
    
    2. DISK AND FILE SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
    
          The floppy disk used by CUBIX is formatted to contain a number  of
       512 byte sectors. The number of sectors on a given disk is  equal  to
       the number of cylinders on the disk,  multiplied  by  the  number  of
       sides (heads) used, multiplied by  the  number  of  sectors  on  each
       track.
    
       2.1 Drive Control Blocks
    
             Each disk drive on the system has its own drive control  block,
          which indicates the status of that particular drive. The format of
          the drive control block is as follows:
    
                        ORG     0           Offset ZERO within DCB
                DCB     EQU     *           Start of Drive Control Block
                DRIVE   RMB     1           Physical device ID of drive.
                NCYL    RMB     1           Number of CYLINDERS on disk
                NHEAD   RMB     1           Number of HEADS used on disk
                NSEC    RMB     1           Number of SECTORS/TRACK on disk
                CYL     RMB     1           CYLINDER to READ/WRITE
                HEAD    RMB     1           HEAD to READ/WRITE
                SEC     RMB     1           SECTOR to READ/WRITE
    
             The DRIVE location indicates to the system, the physical  drive
          ID which is associated with this logical drive. It is used by  the
          lowest level disk drivers to  determine  which  physcal  drive  to
          access.
    
             The NCYL, NHEAD, and NSEC locations describe to the system  the
          exact format of the disk in the drive. These locations are use  by
          the system to determine the size (capacity) of the drive, and  the
          logical sector number to CYLINDER, HEAD, and SECTOR mapping.
    
             The CYL, HEAD, and SEC locations are used by the  lowest  level
          disk drivers in the system to  determine  where  on  the  disk  an
          access is to take place. These locations must be  set  up  by  any
          routine calling the low level drivers.

       2.2 Disk Layout
    
             The disks are logically divided into the following areas:
    
                Sector(s)       Contents
                --------------------------------------
                    0       Root directory sector
                  1-<x>     Sector link map
                <x+1>-<n>   File & directory data space
    
             The highest sector number <n> is equal to the number of sectors
          on the disk minus one. The highest link sector <x>  is  calculated
          by the dividing <n> by 256, and adding 1.
    
             The  size  of  a  disk  (SECTORS,  HEADS,  and  CYLINDERS)   is
          determined by the type of drive used, and the  formatting  of  the
          disk. This information is stored in the drive  control  block  for
          each particular drive.
    
       2.3 Directory Structure
    
             Each  sector  of  the  directory  contains  16  file  directory
          entries, each of which is 32 bytes in  size.  The  format  of  the
          directory entry is defined in the following structure:
    
                        ORG     0           Offset ZERO within entry
                DIRENT  EQU     *           Beginning of directory entry
                DPREFIX RMB     8           File's DIRECTORY PREFIX
                FNAME   RMB     8           File's FILENAME
                FTYPE   RMB     3           File's FILETYPE
                DSKADR  RMB     2           Address of first sector in file
                LODADR  RMB     2           File's LOAD ADDRESS
                FPROT   RMB     1           File's PROTECTION BITS
                SPARE   RMB     8           Available to user applications
    
             When a DIRECTORY PREFIX, FILENAME, or FILETYPE is shorter  than
          it's maximum length, it is padded with zero's on the right.
    
             When a directory entry is not used (contains  no  file  entry),
          then the first byte of the directory prefix is set to  zero.  Thus
          is is not possible to have a file  with  a  zero-length  directory
          prefix.
    
             The  LOAD  ADDRESS  field  contains  a  RAM  address  which  is
          associated with the file. For '.EXE' files, this is the address at
          which the object code is loaded and executed. For files which  are
          not executable, this is simply the address at which the file  will
          be loaded in response to a 'LOAD' command if the  address  is  not
          explicitly given.
    
             The file protection bits used in the 'FPROT' field are  defined
          as follows:
    
                RPERM   EQU     %10000000   READ permission
                WPERM   EQU     %01000000   WRITE permission
                EPERM   EQU     %00100000   EXECUTE permission
                DPERM   EQU     %00010000   DELETE permission
    CUBIX System Programing Guide                                    Page: 3


             The directory may be extended up to the available size  of  the
          disk, and is linked together using the SECTOR  LINK  MAP,  in  the
          same way as all files on the disk are linked.
    
       2.4 Sector Link Map Structure
    
             The sector link map has a 16 bit (two bytes)  entry  for  every
          sector on the disk.
    
             Each entry of the  sector  link  map  contains  the  allocation
          information about the sector it represents.
    
             If the contents of a sector link map entry is $0000,  then  the
          sector which corresponds  to  that  entry  is  free,  and  may  be
          allocated to a file.
    
             If the contents of a sector link map entry is  $FFFF,  the  the
          sector which corresponds to that entry is allocated to a file, and
          is the last sector in that file.
    
             If the contents of a sector link map entry is neither $0000  or
          $FFFF,  then  the  sector  which  corresponds  to  that  entry  is
          allocated to a file, and the value of the entry indicates the next
          sector which is allocated to that file.
    
             Since the directory entry contains the  pointer  to  the  first
          sector in the file, and each sector link map entry  indicates  the
          next sector, the position on the disk of the entire  file  can  be
          determined.
    
             The disk directory is linked to its root sector  zero  (0),  in
          the same manner as a file is linked to its starting sector.
    
             Using this approach, disk drives of up  to  65535  sectors  (32
          Meg) may be accommodated by the file system.

    3. PROGRAM LINKAGE
    
       3.1 Program Initiation
    
             When a program is executed under the CUBIX operating system, it
          is loaded into ram at the address specified by  the  LOAD  ADDRESS
          field in it's directory entry.
    
             The 6809 'B' register will contain the drive number from  which
          the program was loaded.
    
             The 6809 'X' register will  point  to  the  first  free  memory
          location following the loaded image.
    
             The 6809 'Y' register is set to point to  the  first  non-blank
          character in the command line following the program name. If  this
          character is a carriage return or zero byte,  indicating  that  no
          parameters were supplied, then the 6809 'Z' flag will be set.  The
          actual character found will be passed in the 'A' register.
    
          NOTE: The parameters to a program are contained in the  DOS  input
                buffer, and will be destroyed if any System Service Requests
                (SSR's) are executed which allow entry of data  or  commands
                into the DOS input buffer.
    
             Once the program is loaded, and the parameters are set up,  the
          DOS calls the load address of the file,  transferring  control  to
          offset  zero  within  the  loaded  image.  The  stack  pointer  is
          unchanged, and if called directly from the DOS, will point to  the
          DOS internal stack, which contains enough extra space to  be  used
          by small utilitiy programs.
    
       3.2 Program Termination
    
             Under the CUBIX operating system, a program  may  terminate  in
          one of two possible ways.
    
             If the stack has not  been  changed,  the  program  may  simply
          execute an 'RTS' instruction, to return to the caller.
    
          NOTE: This method of returning will return to ANY caller, this  is
                usually the DOS,  but  may  be  another  program  which  has
                executed this program via a DOS command. 'RTS'  should  only
                be used by small utilities, that do not require  or  destroy
                any memory other that it's own image. The top 3K (3072 byte)
                block of memory (below the 1K used by CUBIX) is reserved for
                such small utilities.
    
             A program may use dos call number 0, to return to  DOS  command
          mode. This method of termination will always return  to  the  DOS,
          and should be used by any program which is not a small utility, to
          prevent returning to a calling program after it's image  has  been
          destroyed by memory usage from this program.
    
             In either case, the 6809 'Z' flag must be set  if  the  program
          completed successfully, and is to return a zero  return  code.  An
          easy way to do this is with the 6809 'CLRA' instruction.
    CUBIX System Programing Guide                                    Page: 5


             In order for a program to return  a  specific  value  for  it's
          return code, it must clear the 'Z' flag, and return the  value  in
          the A accumulator. In order to avoid ambiguity, the value returned
          should never be 0 (zero). An easy way to do this is with the  6809
          'LDA' instruction.
    
          NOTE: In order that small  utility  can  return  values  to  their
                caller in the 'A' register, The 'Z' flag  indicates  a  zero
                return code, reguardless  of  the  actual  contents  of  the
                accumulator.
    
    4. SYSTEM SERVICE REQUESTS
    
          The DOS contains a built in interface, which allows requests to be
       made by application programs. The request is handled by the DOS,  and
       a return code is returned to the  the  application,  using  the  same
       return code conventions described  under  the  'Program  Termination'
       section.
    
          The system interface  is  handled  by  the  6809  'SWI'  (Software
       Interrupt) instruction, and is followed  by  a  function  code  byte,
       indicating the request.
    
          The resident assembler 'ASM' supports a SSR directive,  which  can
       be used to generate individual  System  Service  Requests  within  an
       assembly language program.
    
       4.1 SSR Macros
    
             The following is an example  of  a  MACRO  used  with  Dunfield
          Development Systems XASM cross assembler package to  simulate  the
          'SSR' directive. Similar macros can be constructed with any  macro
          assembler.

            ENDMAC
    
       4.2 Description of system requests
    
             Following is a description of the currently implemented  system
          requests. Requests obtaining  information  for  the  command  line
          (pointed to by Y) will accept a space, a  carraige  return,  or  a
          null character ($00) for a terminator.
    
             Unless otherwise stated, each request follows the  return  code
          convention of setting the Z flag if success, and  clearing  the  Z
          flag, and returning a return code value in A if failure.
    
             If an unimplemented DOS request is issued, a message is printed
          indicating the value of  the  request,  and  the  address  of  the
          offending SSR instruction. DOS command mode is then entered.

     0 |   N/A   | Terminates the program and returns directly to the DOS.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     1 |  A,B,Y  | Prompts with '*' and waits for a line of input from the
       |         | Console device, which is buffered within the DOS. On exit,
       |         | 'Y' points to the start of the buffered line, and 'B' has
       |         | The length of the line (excluding the carriage return).
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     2 |  A,B,Y  | As above except Line-feed, Carriage-return is output prior
       |         | To the prompt.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     3 |  A,B,Y  | As SSR 1 except no '*' prompt is issued.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     4 |   A,Y   | Advances 'Y' to the first non-blank character, and sets
       |         | the 'Z' flag if that character is a carriage-return, or a
       |         | NULL ($00). The character found is returned in 'A'
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     5 |   A,Y   | Gets the character pointed to by 'Y', sets the 'Z' flag
       |         | if it is one of a space, carriage-return, or NULL ($00),
       |         | and returns the character in 'A'. 'Y' is advanced by one
       |         | if the character was not a carriage-return or NULL.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     6 | A,B,X,Y | Gets a 16 bit decimal number from the line pointed to by
       |         | 'Y', and returns it in the 'X' register. The lower 8 bits
       |         | of the number are also returned in 'B'. 'Y' is advanced to
       |         | the next non-blank character following the number.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     7 | A,B,X,Y | Gets a 16 bit hexidecimal number from the line pointed to
       |         | by 'Y', and returns it in the 'X' register. The lower 8
       |         | bits of the number are also returned in the 'B'. 'Y' is
       |         | advanced to point to the next non-blank after the number.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     8 | A,B,X,Y | Gets a 16 bit number from the line pointed to by 'Y', in
       |         | the same way as SSR 6 or 7 above. If the number begins
       |         | with '$', a hexidecimal number is expected, otherwise a
       |         | decimal number is assumed.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
     9 | A,B,X,Y | Gets and buffers within the DOS a file specification
       |         | pattern from the line pointed to by 'Y'. On exit, 'Y'
       |         | is advanced past the pattern, and 'X' points to the start
       |         | of the directory name portion of the saved pattern which
       |         | has been converted to directory entry format.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
    10 | A,B,X,Y | As above except that a DOS error (1) is generated if the
       |         | specification pattern does not specify a single file.
       |         | (I.E: It contains wildcard characters)
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
    11 | A,B,X,Y | As SSR 9, except that no FILETYPE is expected, on exit 'X'
       |         | Points to the FILETYPE portion of the saved pattern, which
       |         | must be set to a three character type.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------
    12 | A,B,X,Y | As SSR 11, except that the directory prefix defaults to
       |         | the SYSTEM directory, not the DEFAULT directory.
    ---+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------

    14 | A,B,X,Y | Gets and buffers within the DOS a directory prefix name
       |         | only. On exit, 'X' points to FILENAME portion of DOS

       4.3 Dos File Specification Pattern
    
             Some the System Service Requests make use of the DOS Saved File
          Specification Pattern. This file specification is contained within
          DOS, and once set up by the apprioprate SSR's, informs DOS of  the
          file specification pattern to be used  for  subsequent  operations
          requiring filenames.
    
             The Saved File Specificaton Pattern is the following format:
    
                        ORG     0           Offset ZERO within FSP
                FSP     EQU     *           File Spec. Pattern Starts Here
                FSDRIVE RMB     1           Drive Index (0-3)
                FSDIR   RMB     8           DIRECTORY PREFIX
                FSNAME  RMB     8           FILENAME
                FSTYPE  RMB     3           FILETYPE
    
             With the exception of the FSDRIVE field,  the  DOS  saved  file
          specification pattern is in exactly the same format  as  the  file
          specification portion of an entry in the disk directory.
    
             For consistancy with directory entries, the SSR's which  return
          pointers to the saved file specification pattern return a  pointer
          to the FSDIR entry, with the FSDRIVE entry being referenced at  an
          offset of -1 from that pointer. This allows the  DIRCTORY  PREFIX,
          FILENAME, and FILETYPE to be referenced at the samed offsets  into
          either a directory entry of a file specification pattern.
    
    5. DOS RETURN CODES
    
          The following return codes are generated by DOS commands,  Utility
       programs, and System Service Requests.
    
            0   - Success, command, program, or system request worked.
            1   - Operand to command or SSR was invalid or not supplied.
            2   - Requested file does not exist on the disk.
            3   - Operation failed because file is protected.
            4   - Attempt to read file not open for read.
            5   - Attempt to write file not open for write.
            6   - End of file encountered while reading.
            7   - Seek beyond end of file.
            8   - Attempt to create a file failed because the file
                  already exists on the disk.
            9   - Attempt to allocate a disk sector failed because there
                  is no available free space on the disk.
            10  - Physical disk error occured while reading or writing
                  to the disk.
            11  - Attempt to access a serial device for which no device
                  driver is installed.
            12  - Attempt to download a file from a device failed because
                  of a format error in the file.
            255 - Command was not recognized as a valid DOS command.

    6. FILE CONTROL BLOCKS
    
          When a file is opened via a system service request, the  DOS  uses
       its FILE CONTROL block to maintain its state until it is closed. This
       file control block is an area of memory supplied by the user  issuing
       the OPEN request, and is pointed to in all  cases  by  the  6809  'U'
       register.
    
          The format of the file control block is as follows:
    
                        ORG     0           Offset ZERO within FCB
                FCB     EQU     *           Begining of control block
                OPEN    RMB     1           Type of OPEN (1=READ, 2=WRITE)
                FDRIVE  RMB     1           Drive index where file is located
                FIRST   RMB     2           First sector in file
                SECTOR  RMB     2           Sector being accessed
                LASTSEC RMB     2           Last sector accessed
                OFFSET  RMB     2           Offset into character buffer
                CHRBUF  RMB     512         Buffer for character access
    
          CHRBUF is used for CHARACTER accesses  only,  this  space  is  not
       required if the file is only being BLOCK accessed. OFFSET will always
       be zero for BLOCK accessed files.
    
          Once a file has been accessed using the CHARACTER system calls, it
       should not be BLOCK accessed until enough characters have  been  read
       or written to set OFFSET back to zero. This will be a multiple of 512
       characters.
