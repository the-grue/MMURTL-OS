    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          ED is a tiny screen oriented window  editor,  which  runs  on  the
       motorola 6809 under the CUBIX operating  system,  using  a  VT100  or
       compatable terminal. It is patterned after  a  screen  editor  widely
       used on popular minicomputers, but is much simpler and supports  only
       a small subset of that editors  features.  Its  main  advantages  are
       small size and simple user interface.
    
    2. INVOKING ED
    
          To use ED to edit a file, issue the following command to the DOS:
    
                               ' ED <filename> '
    
          Where <filename> is the name of the file you wish to edit. If  the
       named file already exists, then ED will  load  it  into  memory,  and
       begin the editing session. If the file did not already exist, ED will
       display the message 'NEW FILE' in the message window  at  the  bottom
       left hand corner of the screen, and present you with a  blank  screen
       into which you can enter and  edit  data.  When  the  data  entry  is
       complete, and you issue the 'EXIT' command, ED will create the  file,
       and save the data in it.

    3. EDITING WITH ED
    
          When ED is invoked, it will clear  the  screen,  and  display  the
       first 22 lines of the file. The message '[EOF]' is displayed  at  the
       end of the file, if that portion  of  the  file  is  visible  on  the
       screen.
    
          Any non-displayable (control) characters will be  displayed  as  a
       printable character in reverse video. EG:  A  BELL  character,  is  a
       CONTROL-G, and will be shown on the screen as a reverse 'G'.
    
          The ASCII  delete  character  'DEL'  is  displayed  as  a  reverse
       underline.
    
          ED allows data to be entered into the file, always at the position
       of the terminal cursor on the screen. Any ASCII text can be typed in,
       and will be inserted at the position indicated by the cursor.
    
          In order  to  help  avoid  errors,  ED  normally  rejects  control
       characters if they are entered, but will  accept  them  if  they  are
       preceded by an <escape> character. To  enter  an  <escape>  character
       into the text, simply press the escape key twice.
    
          The cursor keys on the terminal can  be  used  to  reposition  the
       cursor to any desired position within the text. If the cursor reaches
       the upper or lower boundarys of the editing window, then the text  in
       the window will be scrolled in the direction desired.
    
          The cursor may only move over the areas of screen which represents
       actual text in the file. If the cursor is moved up or  down  via  the
       cursor keys to a line which is not long enough to reach the  previous
       horizontal cursor position, then ED will move the cursor in  the  the
       end of that line. In this case, ED will remember the previous  cursor
       position, and if further up or down movement is made via  the  cursor
       keys, ED will attempt to restore the cursor to it's  previous  cursor
       position. Any other key except for the up and down cursor  keys  will
       reset this "remembered" horizontal position.

       3.1 Keypad key functions
    
             The keypad of the VT-100 or compatable terminal is used  by  ED
          to perform several editing functions. The keys on the keypad  have
          the following meaning to ED:
    
          3.1.1 PF1 (Command)
    
                Pressing this key causes ED to prompt for a command  in  the
             message window (at the bottom lefthand corner of  the  screen),
             and allows an ED  command  to  be  typed  in.  The  command  is
             terminated by pressing of the keypad keys, or the cursor keys.
    
          3.1.2 PF2 (Help)
    
                Pressing this key causes ED to display a  short  summary  of
             the special keys used by ED, and a summary of commands.
    
          3.1.3 PF3 (Find)
    
                Pressing this key causes ED to prompt for a  string  in  the
             messasge window, and allows a string to be entered  (Terminated
             by any keypad key).  ED  will  then  search  for  that  string,
             starting with  the  second  line  currently  displayed  on  the
             screen, and if it finds it, will move the display such that the
             line containing the string is at the top of the screen. If  the
             string is not found,a  message  is  displayed  in  the  message
             window, indicating so.
    
          3.1.4 PF4 (Delete Line)
    
                Pressing this key causes ED to delete  all  characters  from
             the cursor up to and including the end of the line  the  cursor
             is on.
    
          3.1.5 [0] (Advance line)
    
                This key moves the cursor  to  the  beginning  of  the  line
             following the line is which it is currently positioned.
    
          3.1.6 [1] (Backup Line)
    
                This key moves the cursor to the beginning of the line it is
             on. If the cursor was already at the start of the line, then it
             is moved to the start of the previous line.
    
          3.1.7 [2] (End of line)
    
                This key moves the cursor to the  end  of  the  line  it  is
             currently on. If the cursor was already at the end of the line,
             then it is moved to the end of the next line.

          3.1.8 [3] (Delete to Buffer)
    
                This key functions exactly the same as the (Delete Line) key
             except that the text which is deleted is  also  appended  to  a
             buffer  called  the  "insert  buffer".  This  buffer   may   be
             reinserted into the text at  a  different  location  using  the
             (Insert Buffer) key.
    
          3.1.9 [4] (Top of File)
    
                This key moves to and displays the first  22  lines  of  the
             file.
    
          3.1.10 [5] (Bottom of File)
    
                This key moves to and displays the  last  22  lines  of  the
             file.
    
          3.1.11 [6] (Insert Buffer)
    
                Pressing this key inserts the entire contents of the  insert
             buffer at the current cursor position. This has the  effect  of
             inserting all lines which were deleted  using  the  (Delete  to
             Buffer) key. The insert buffer is also reset,  causing  further
             Deletes to the buffer to start with an empty buffer.
    
          3.1.12 [7] (Page Back)
    
                Pressing this key causes ED to  backup  the  display  by  21
             lines, thereby moving the line currently displayed at  the  top
             of the screen to the bottom of the screen.
    
          3.1.13 [8] (Page forward)
    
                Pressing this key causes ED to advance  the  display  by  21
             lines, threreby moving the  line  currently  displayed  at  the
             bottom of the screen to the top of the screen.
    
          3.1.14 [9] (Find Next)
    
                This key operates the same as the (Find) key, except that ED
             does not prompt for the string to  search  for,  but  uses  the
             string from the last find operation.
    
          3.1.15 [-] (Undelete Line)
    
                This key inserts all of the text which was deleted  via  the
             (Delete Line) key, at the current cursor position.
    
          3.1.16 [,] (Delete Character)
    
                This key delete's the character under the cursor.
    
          3.1.17 [.] (Reset Buffer)
    
                This  key  resets  the  insert  buffer,  causing  subsequent
             deletes to the buffer to begin with an empty buffer.

          3.1.18 [ENTER] (Toggle Insert Mode)
    
                Pressing this key toggles INSERT mode on and off. A  message
             is shown in the message window, indicating the  current  insert
             status (After it is toggled). When INSERT mode is toggled  OFF,
             any text that is typed  into  the  editor  will  overwrite  the
             current contents of the  file.  The  following  characters  are
             always inserted, regardless of the state of INSERT mode:
    
                1) - Carriage returns (new lines)
                2) - Spaces produced by the TAB key.
                3) - Any character typed at the end of a line.
    
       3.2 Other keys
    
             The following other (non keypad) keys have special  meaning  to
          ED:
    
    
          3.2.1 <ESC> (Escape Key)
    
                This key if pressed will cause the next character  typed  to
             be entered into the text exactly as it is received. This allows
             control codes, and keys  recognized  by  ED  (EG:  TAB)  to  be
             entered into the text.
    
          3.2.2 <TAB> (Tab Key)
    
                Pressing this key will insert spaces into the text, up until
             the next TAB STOP. Tab stops begin in column number  nine,  and
             continue every eight character positions after that.
    
          3.2.3 <DEL> (Delete Key)
    
                Pressing this key deletes the  character  to  the  immediate
             left of the cursor, and backs the cursor up one position.

       3.3 ED Commands
    
             The following commands can be entered by pressing the (Command)
          Key (PF1).
    
             (Capital letters indicate minimum abreviation required).
             (Square braces indicate optional operands)
    
          3.3.1 APpend <filename>
    
                Appends the specified  file  to  the  file  currently  being
             edited.
    
          3.3.2 DOs [<command>]
    
                Executed the DOS  command  specified  by  <command>.  If  no
             command is given, then the DOS is entered, allowing  return  to
             ED via the DOS 'RETURN' command. Care must be taken not to load
             of execute anything which would load or use memory  on  top  of
             ED, or the file being edited.
    
          3.3.3 EXit
    
                Terminates ED, saving the file.
    
          3.3.4 QUIT
    
                Terminates ED, without saving the  file.  Any  changes  made
             since the start of the editing  session,  or  the  last  'SAVE'
             command are lost.
    
          3.3.5 SAve <filename>
    
                Saves the contents of the file being edited in the specified
             file. If no <filename> is specified, the file  is  saved  under
             it's own name.
    
          3.3.6 SPAces
    
                Expands any tab characters in the file to the correct number
             of spaces, using the same tab stops as the TAB key.  For  large
             files, this command may take some time to execute.
    
          3.3.7 TABs
    
                Converts spaces in a file to TAB characters, using the  same
             tab stops as the TAB key.
    
                If a NULL LINE is entered in response to the command prompt,
             ED will refresh the screen. IE: To get a screen refresh,  press
             the command key twice.
