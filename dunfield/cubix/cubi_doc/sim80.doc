    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          SIM80 is an simulator for the Intel 8080 processor, which runs  on
       the motorola 6809 under CUBIX. It allows software written for an 8080
       to be run on the 6809.
    
       1.1 DIFFERENCES
             SIM80 exactly emulates the 8080 instructions and  architecture,
          except for the following:
    
          1) SIM80 executes slower than a hardware 8080.
    
          2) The parity flag is not supported, along with the parity testing
             instructions (JPE, JPO, CPE, CPO, RPE, RPO). Most 8080 software
             does not use the parity flag, and it was decided emulating  the
             parity flag was not worth  the  reduction  in  emulation  speed
             which would be incurred, as this is an operation  not  directly
             supported on the 6809.
    
          3) The I/O instructions 'IN' and 'OUT' are not  supported  because
             the 6809 has no I/O address space.  The  'OUT'  instruction  is
             used to interface to the 6809 operating system (Below).
    
          4) The enable/disable interrupts instructions 'EI'  and  'DI'  are
             not supported due to lack of  physical  interrupt  lines  on  a
             simulated processor.
    
          5) The 8080 restart instructions are not supported.
    
             If SIM80 encounters a halt instruction, and invalid opcode,  or
          an unsupported  opcode,  it  issues  an  appropriate  message  and
          terminates, returning to the 6809 DOS.

    2. USING SIM80
    
          To run an 8080 program under SIM80, first download the  8080  code
       into a file with the type '.80'. Then, to execute the  8080  program,
       type: ' SIM80 <filename> ' where <filename> is the name of  the  file
       containing the 8080 code.
    
          The 'DE' register pair of the emulated 8080 processor will be  set
       to point to the command line after the filename, allowing operands to
       be parsed by the program under simulation.
    
          The 'SP' register of the emulated 8080 processor will  be  set  to
       point to the top of available memory.
    
    3. INTERFACE TO 6809 OPERATING SYSTEM
    
          SIM80 supports an interface to the 6809 DOS (CUBIX) via the unused
       8080 'OUT' instruction. When an OUT instruction is encountered by the
       simulator, the 8080 registers are mapped to  the  6809  registers  as
       follows:
    
                    8080         6809
    
                    B-C   <==>    A-B (D)
                    D-E   <==>    Y
                    H-L   <==>    X
    
          SIM80 then executes the system call indicated by the  port  number
       specified by the OUT instruction. After the system call is performed,
       the processor registers are mapped back, the  return  code  from  the
       system call is placed  in  the  8080  'A'  register,  and  simulation
       resumes.

       3.1 Debug mode
    
             The simulator has a  built  in  8080  debugger,  which  can  be
          invoked by the '/DEBUG' qualifier on the SIM80 command.
    
                        Eg:  ' SIM80/DEBUG <filename> '
    
             If this qualifier is used, SIM80 will load  the  file,  display
          the starting address, and then prompt with '8080> '. The following
          commands may now be entered:
    
    
    
      SET    TRACE                     - Enable/Disable TRACE mode.
             NOTRACE
    
             PSW <value>
             BC  <value>
             DE  <value>               - Set contents of 8080 Registers.
             HL  <value>
             SP  <value>
             PC  <value>
    
             BRKPT <0-7> <address>     - Set breakpoint.
    
    
      DISPLAY                          - Displays registers and breakpoints.
      MEMORY <start addr> <end addr>   - Display memory.
    
      STORE <address> <byt1> <byt2>... - Store into memory.
    
      EXIT                             - Exit debugger.
    
      GO                               - Begin simulation, If TRACE is
                                         enabled, then address, opcode
                                         and registers  are  displayed
                                         as simulation  occurs.  <ESC>
                                         key can be used to abort.
    
      STEP                             - Similar to  go,  but  prompts
                                         with ':' and waits for  space
                                         before simulating  each  8080
                                         instruction. <CR> exits.
    
    NOTE: SIM80 executes considerably SLOWER when using the '/DEBUG'
          qualifier.
