    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          CUBIX (also refered to as DOS) is a disk  operating  system  which
       runs on the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. It is intended to be a  ROM
       resident system, and occupies about 6.5 kilobytes of memory excluding
       I/O drivers. A single 8K ROM provides ample  space  to  implement  an
       entire CUBIX system.
    
          CUBIX provides many facilities, including a file system, a command
       line interpreter, a command file processor, and an extensive  library
       of system services available to applications programs.
    
          CUBIX may be implemented on any computer system that  has  a  6809
       central processing unit (CPU), at least one disk drive, and a console
       terminal (or integrated keyboard/video display). For  information  on
       porting CUBIX to a  new  hardware  platform,  see  the  CUBIX  SYSTEM
       PORTING GUIDE.
    
       1.1 Getting Started
    
             When the system is powered on, it first performs a test of  the
          CUBIX ROM and the  system  RAM.  These  tests  will  take  several
          seconds, and may be aborted by pressing  the  ESCAPE  key  on  the
          console terminal.
    
             Following the startup tests, CUBIX outputs its  hearld  message
          and copyright notice.
    
             If the startup tests were not aborted,  the  system  will  then
          look for a file with the FILENAME 'A:[MAIN]STARTUP.*', and  if  it
          is found, it is processed according to its FILETYPE  in  the  same
          manner as are commands  executed  from  the  SYSTEM  LIBRARY  (See
          SYSTEM LIBRARY).
    
             Finally, CUBIX will enter its internal command  mode  processor
          and output a '*' prompt, awaiting further commands.

    2. THE FILE SYSTEM
    
          The CUBIX file system consists of a set of routines within the DOS
       that allow controlled access to the disk for storage and retrieval of
       programs and information. Individual programs or collections of  data
       on the disk are called files.
    
          A disk file is a collection of data which is contained on the disk
       in an  organized  and  accessable  structure.  The  DOS  maintains  a
       directory of all files  present  on  the  disk,  as  well  as  a  map
       indicating which disk  sectors  belong  to  which  files,  and  which
       sectors are available for use.
    
          File access is under the control of the DOS,  and  has  two  major
       types, BLOCK and CHARACTER.
    
       2.1 BLOCK files
    
             BLOCK files are written to and read from the disk directly from
          system memory in  512  byte  blocks.  Block  files  are  always  a
          multiple of 512 bytes long, and may contain all  data  bytes  from
          $00 to $FF ('$' indicates a hexidecimal number). Data transfer  to
          and from block files is the fastest form of disk file access.
    
       2.2 CHARACTER files
    
             CHARACTER files are written to and read from the disk a  single
          character at a time. (Data is actually  buffered  and  transferred
          to/from the disk in 512 byte blocks by the DOS).  Character  files
          may be any length (But will always occupy a multiple of 512  bytes
          of disk space), and may contain any data  bytes  except  for  $FF,
          which is used as an END OF FILE marker.
    
          The DOS does not make any actual  distinction  between  BLOCK  and
       CHARACTER files, allowing block files to be read as  characters,  and
       character files to be read in blocks. Note that if a file saved as  a
       block file contains the data byte $FF, the  remainder  of  that  file
       will not be accessable when performing a character read.
    
       2.3 File names
    
             DOS files are always identified and accessed through  a  unique
          FILE SPECIFICATION name.  File  specification's  consist  of  four
          parts, a DRIVE SPECIFIER, a DIRECTORY PREFIX, the actual FILENAME,
          and a FILETYPE
    
             The DRIVE SPECIFIER is a single character drive name, which  is
          in the range of 'A' to 'D', and indicates one  of  the  four  disk
          drives supported by the operating system. The drive  specifier  is
          an optional part of the file specification, and if supplied,  must
          be separated from the remainder of the  file  specification  by  a
          colon (':'). If a drive is not specified, the DOS uses a  default.
          The default when the system is first brought up is 'A:',  and  may
          be changed by the user at any time with the "SET DEFAULT" command.
    CUBIX User Guide                                                 Page: 3


             The DIRECTORY PREFIX is a string  of  up  to  eight  characters
          included in each files directory entry, which provides a means  of
          separating the files on the disk into  logically  related  groups,
          each group having it's own unique directory prefix. The  directory
          prefix is an optional part  of  the  file  specification,  and  if
          supplied, must  be  separated  from  the  remainder  of  the  file
          specification by placing it within square  brackets,  directly  in
          front of the FILENAME. If the directory prefix is  not  specified,
          the DOS uses a default. The  default  when  the  system  is  first
          brought up is'[MAIN]', and may be changed by the user at any  time
          with the "SET DEFAULT" command.
    
             The FILENAME is a  string  of  up  to  eight  characters  which
          specifies the actual name of the file.
    
             The FILETYPE is a  string  of  up  to  three  characters  which
          specifies the type of the file. It follows the filename, separated
          from it by a dot ('.').  The  filetype  is  used  to  specify  the
          purpose of the file. There are several filetypes recognized by the
          DOS and its utility programs, and indicate files  with  particular
          meaning to the DOS  or  utility.  For  a  list  of  commonly  used
          filetypes, refer to the appendix on file types.
    
          2.3.1 Sample Filename
    
                A:[PREFIX]FILENAME.TYP
                ^    ^       ^      ^
                |    |       |      +----- FILETYPE
                |    |       +------------ FILENAME
                |    +-------------------- DIRECTORY PREFIX
                +------------------------- DRIVE SPECIFIER
    
       2.4 Wildcards
    
             Some comamnds and utilities  allow  the  use  of  the  WILDCARD
          character '*' in a file specification, which means 'anything'  for
          example, to display the names of  all  executable  ('.EXE')  files
          with all directory prefixes on the disk in drive  'B',  you  could
          enter the command:
    
                                'DIR B:[*]*.EXE'
    
             The WILDCARD may also be used as the LAST part of a section  of
          the file specification. For example, the command:
    
                                  'DIR ABC*.*'
    
          would display the names of  all  files  (On  the  current  default
          drive, and with the current default directory prefix)  which  have
          FILENAMES beginning with 'ABC'.
    
             Note that the WILDCARD character '*' may NOT  be  used  in  the
          DRIVE SPECIFIER portion of a file specification.
    CUBIX User Guide                                                 Page: 4


       2.5 File Protections
    
             Each file on the disk has in it's directory entry, a bit  field
          which indicates which file system operations may be  performed  on
          the file. The names of the bits, and the operations which  may  be
          performed are:
    
                (R)ead      - The file may be read or loaded.
                (W)rite     - The file may be written to or saved.
                (E)xecute   - For '.EXE' files, it may be executed.
                              For  '.@'  files it may be invoked as
                              a command file.
                (D)elete    - The file may be deleted from the disk.
    
             When a file is first created, the protection bits  are  set  to
          allow all of the above operations.  The  protection  bits  may  be
          altered with the 'SET FILE' command.
    
       2.6 Load Address
    
             Each file on the disk has in it's  directory  entry  a  16  bit
          address field called the load address.  This  is  the  address  at
          which the file will be loaded in response to a 'LOAD' command,  if
          no address is explicitly supplied.
    
             For '.EXE' files, the load address indicates  where  in  memory
          the file will be loaded when it is executed.
    
    3. SERIAL DEVICES
    
          CUBIX at any one time can recognize up to  eight  serial  devices,
       which are referenced as devices 0 to 7. The device drivers for  these
       devices may be installed and de-installed dynamically, as the  system
       is running.
    
          At any one time, one particular device is designated as the system
       console, and it is via this device that the  DOS  and  most  programs
       running under it  communicate.  The  active  console  device  may  be
       changed by the user at any time with the "SET CONSOLE" command.
    
          When a CUBIX system is first  brought  up,  the  following  device
       assignments are in effect:
    
          Device     Description
            0           NULL device, never returns a character, and throws
                        away any characters output to it.
            1           SYSTEM CONSOLE, the console terminal or integrated
                        keyboard/video display appears here.
           2-7          System dependant.
    
          Any unused device driver vectors are initialized  to  zero,  which
       will cause a device error if the corresponding device is referenced.

    4. COMMAND MODE
    
          Whenever CUBIX is expecting a command, it prompts with '*' on  the
       console terminal, and is said to be in COMMAND MODE. While in command
       mode,  DOS  commands  can  be  entered  from  the  console  terminal,
       terminated by the <return> key, and will be executed by the DOS.  The
       <backspace> or <delete> keys can be used to correct  typing  mistakes
       when entering commands.
    
       4.1 Return Codes
    
             When a DOS command, utility, or application program terminates,
          it  passes  back  to  its  caller  (usually  DOS)  a  return  code
          indicating if it completed successfully or not. A return  code  of
          ZERO indicates successful completion, and will not be displayed by
          the dos. If a DOS command, utility, or application program returns
          a NON-ZERO return code, the DOS will display the message  'Rc=<n>'
          where <n> is the value of the return code.
    
             The return code message is in  addition  to  the  normal  error
          messages,  and  is  actually  generated  by   the   command   mode
          interpreter, and therefore will not be displayed  unless  the  DOS
          command, utility, or application program is returning directly  to
          dos command mode.
    
             For information on the meaning of specific return codes,  refer
          to the appendix on return codes.
    
    5. THE SYSTEM LIBRARY
    
          Whenever a command is given to DOS that it does not recognize as a
       command of its own, It examines the SYSTEM LIBRARY for any file  with
       a FILENAME which is the same as the command. If a file by  that  name
       is found, it's FILETYPE is examined, and if it is '.EXE', the file is
       loaded  and  just  as  if  the  user  had   entered   'RUN   [<system
       lib>]<command>'.  If  the  FILETYPE  is  '.@',  then  the   file   is
       interpreted as a  command  file,  just  as  if  the  user  had  typed
       '@[<system lib>]<command>'. In both of the above cases, the remainder
       of the command line is passed to the file as parameters.
    
          The the FILETYPE found by the above search is not '.EXE' or  '.@',
       then the DOS makes a second search of the system library, looking for
       a '.EXE' file with a FILENAME which is the same as  the  FILETYPE  of
       the first file. If this is found, it is loaded and run, and is passed
       the  entire  command  line  (including  the  origional  command)   as
       parameters.
    
          If none of the above conditions are met, the DOS will display  the
       message 'Unrecognized command', and reject the command  line  with  a
       return code of 255.
    CUBIX User Guide                                                 Page: 6


          The DOS uses a special drive specifier  and  directory  prefix  to
       identify files belonging to the SYSTEM LIBRARY. When  the  system  is
       first brought up the drive and prefix are 'A:[SYSTEM]',  and  may  be
       changed by the user at any time with the "SET SYSTEM" command.
    
          Commands entered in the above matter may be preceded  by  a  drive
       specifier and/or a directory prefix, which overrides  that  used  for
       the system library.
    
    6. COMMAND FILES
    
          Command files provide a  method  of  executing  DOS  commands  and
       programs from a text file, instead of from the console keyboard as is
       normally done. This is a convenient way of grouping together a number
       of separate commands so that they will all be executed by typing only
       one command on the console.
    
          To  run  a  command  file,   simply   type   '@<filename>'   where
       '<filename>' is the FILENAME given to the command file.
    
          The following functions are available in command files ONLY:
    
       ?A<n>
    
          Advances <n> lines in the command file and continues from there.
    
       ?E[<n>]
    
          Exits (terminates) the command file. If  <n>  is  specified,  that
       value will be the command file's return code. If not  specified,  the
       return code will be that from the last command  executed  within  the
       file.
    
       ?F<comamnd>
    
          Executes the command contained within the remainder  of  the  line
       only if the last DOS command or executed program failed  (Returned  a
       NON-ZERO return code).
    
       ?I
    
          Reads the  command  file  parameter  variables  (?0-?9)  from  the
       console, after prompting with '*'.
    
       ?K
    
          Reads a single keystroke from the console  terminal,  and  returns
       the value of the character entered as the return code.
    
       ?O<text string>
    
          Outputs the remainder of the line to the terminal.
    
       ?P<text string>
    
          Prints the remainder of the line on the terminal, with a line feed
       and carriage return at the end.
    CUBIX User Guide                                                 Page: 7


       ?R<n> <comamnd>
    
          Executes the command on the remainder of the line only of the last
       DOS command or executed program terminated with return code <n>.
    
       ?S<command>
    
          Executes the command on the remainder of the line only if the last
       DOS command or executed program was successful (ZERO return code).
    
       ?0-?9
    
          Parameters to the command file may be referenced by the names from
       '?0' to '?9', with '?0' being the name of the command file, and  '?1'
       being the first parameter.
    
       ?= <tokens>
    
          Assignes the tokens on the remainder of the line  to  the  '?0-?9'
       command file parameter variables.
    
       ??<string1> <string2>
    
          Returns  a  ZERO  return  code  if  the  two  strings  match,  255
       otherwise.
    
       ?@<file>
    
          Provides a method of chaining  command  files  without  the  stack
       overhead involved with nesting them. The currently executing  command
       file is terminated, and the new command file is begun.
    
       ?*
    
          Comment, remainder of line is ignored.
    
    
          Command files may be nested to any depth (Up to available space on
       the system stack), HOWEVER!!!, the parameters to a command  file  are
       NOT saved when another command file is invoked, meaning that when one
       command file calls another, it's old parameter values will  be  lost,
       and replaced by the those given to the new  command  file.  A  useful
       trick is to pass any parameters that you need to retain  to  the  new
       command file is parameter  positions  beyond  those  which  it  uses,
       allowing the origional value to be  retained  in  the  new  parameter
       position.
    
       NOTE: If SSR (System Service Request) #101 is issued from within  any
       program executing under the command file, all commands files will  be
       terminated.

          Commands shown with a type of  INTERNAL  are  commands  which  are
       built into the operating system. They do not have to be  loaded  from
       disk every time they are executed.
    
          APPLICATIONS are commands which reside on  disk,  and  are  loaded
       every time that they are executed. Applications always return to  DOS
       when they terminate. When an executing  application  invokes  another
       application, the first application is terminated.
    
          UTILITIES are special applications that follow certain rules which
       allow them to be invoked from an application without terminating  it.
       Applications  invoking  utilities  will  resume  execution  when  the
       utility terminates.
    
          COMMAND FILES are lists of other commands contained within a file,
       which are sequentially executed as one command.
    
          SPECIAL commands are commands  of  another  type,  which  for  one
       reason or another do not behave exactly  as  indicated  above.  These
       commands are intimate with operating system, in order  to  accomplish
       unusual tasks.
    
          Most applications and utilities will display a  short  summary  of
       the command syntax and available options if given  "?"  as  a  single
       operand.

                                  /TERM     - List output to terminal, not file.
    
          The ASM command invokes the resident 6809 assembler, to assemble a
       source file into an intermediate object file. The  <pgmname>  operand
       is the name of the source file to be assembled. The assembler  always
       assumes a file type of '.ASM'. The file will  be  assembled,  and  an
       object file ('.OBJ') will be generated.  The  listing  file  will  be
       placed in <pgmname>.LST if it is not directed to the console with the
       '/TERM' qualifier.
    
          The '/ERROR' qualifier causes only those lines  containing  errors
       to be displayed in the listing. This is very useful for debugging.
    
          The '/SYMBOL' qualifier causes ASM to append a sorted  display  of
       the symbol table, to the listing file.
    
          The '/FAST' qualifier causes ASM to skip the optimization  passes,
       causing all offsets to be calculated  as  16  bits,  all  unspecified
       memory  references  will  use  extended   addressing,   and   forward
       references in EQUate statements will  not  work.  This  qualifier  is
       useful to speed up the assembly process, when initially  debugging  a
       program.
    
          Unless the '/QUIET' qualifier is given, ASM will  output  progress
       messages, indicating what stage of assembly it is performing.
    
          For more information, consult the ASM manual.

                                  /SOURCE   - Include source file as comments.
    
          ASP  is  an  Assembly  Source  code  Preprocessor,  which  accepts
       structured  constructs  such  as  IF/THEN/ELSE  and  WHILE/END,   and
       converts them to standard assembler source code.
    
          ASP accepts a file with the name '<pgmname>.ASP', and  produces  a
       file with the name '<pgmname>.ASM', which is ready to be assembled.
    
          Any errors discovered by the preprocessor  are  displayed  on  the
       console.
    
          The '/COMMENT' qualifier causes ASP to copy any comments from  the
       source file into the output file. This is useful in  cases  where  an
       ASP source file is being permanently converted to  assembler  source,
       and will be maintained in the assembly source format.
    
          The '/QUIET' qualifier prevents ASP from displaying  its  progress
       messages.
    
          The '/SOURCE' qualifier causes ASP to include each line  from  the
       source file in the output file as a comment,  beginning  with  '*>>'.
       This  comment  line  will  appear  in  the  output  file  immediately
       preceding the lines of assembler code generated by it.

                                  /QUIET    - Inhibit output file statistics.
    
          The BUILD command takes an intermediate object  file  such  as  is
       produced by the assember, and builds a complete program image.
    
          The '/MHX' qualifier causes BUILD to make a  Motorola  Hexidecimal
       Format download image, and  place  it  in  a  '.MHX'  file.  If  this
       qualifier is NOT given, BUILD makes an executable image,  and  places
       it in a '.EXE' file. In all cases, the FILENAME of the  created  file
       will be the same as that of the intermediate '.OBJ' file.
    
          Unless the '/KEEP' qualifier  is  given,  BUILD  will  delete  the
       intermediate '.OBJ' file, before writing out the new image file.
    
          The '/QUIET' qualifier prevents BUILD from  displaying  statistics
       about the newly created executable  image,  as  well  as  the  output
       filename for both types of image files.

          CALC is a  simple  Hexidecimal/Decimal  desk  calculator.  If  the
       operand <expression> is supplied, CALC evaluates it, and displays the
       results in both decimal and hexidecimal. If  CALC  is  not  given  an
       operand,  it  enters  an  interactive  session,   and   prompts   for
       expressions, which it evaluates and displays. Entering  a  NULL  line
       will terminate interactive CALC.
    
          CALC assumes input numbers  are  decimal,  unless  preceded  by  a
       dollar sign (hexidecimal),  a  percent  sign  (binary),  a  '@'  sign
       (octal), or is enclosed within single quotes,  which  indicates  that
       the ASCII character value is to be used.
    
          CALC evaluates expressions from left to right,  with  no  operator
       precedence.
    
          The following operators are recognised by CALC:
    
          Monadic (Single operand) operators:
    
          - Negation (calculate negative value)
          ~ Complement (Invert all zero's and one's).
          = Swap (Exchange high and low bytes)
    
          Dyadic (two operand) operators:
    
          + Addition.
          - Subtraction
          * Multiplication
          / Division

       directory prefix. The usual '[' & ']' square brackets  surrounding  a
       directory name are optional with the CD command.
    
          CD displays  the  full  drive  and  directory  name  of  your  new
       directory.
    
          If no operand is given to CD, it simply displays the full name  of
       your current default directory.

          CHGDISK is a utility that allows you to  load  an  application  or
       utility program from one disk, and place a  new  disk  in  the  drive
       before it is executed.
    
          If CHGDISK is invoked with no operands. It  first  prompts  for  a
       command string, allowing you to change disks (In case the command you
       wish to execute is on a different disk from the CHGDISK utility).
    
          Once the command is entered,  CHGDISK  reads  the  application  or
       utility program from the disk, and prompts for you to change disks.
    
          After changing disks, press <RETURN>, CHGDISK  will  then  execute
       the loaded program.
    
          If a command string is given as an operand  to  CHGDISK,  it  will
       load it from disk immediately. In this case, the command must  reside
       on the same disk as CHGDISK.

          CHKDISK tests the integrity of a disk.
    
          CHKDISK first verifies the consistancy  of  the  file  system,  by
       ensuring  that  all  files  are  linked  correctly,   containing   no
       unallocated sectors  and  that  no  two  files  share  common  sector
       linkage. CHKDISK also detects at this time if any sectors are  marked
       as allocated, but not used in any  files.  The  '/NOALLOC'  qualifier
       will cause CHKDISK to skip this test.
    
          CHKDISK next performs a media test, verifying that all sectors  on
       the disk are usable. The '/NOMEDIA' qualifier will cause  CHKDISK  to
       skip this test.
    
          During both tests, CHKDISK keeps an  internal  copy  of  the  disk
       linkage table, which it updates to repair any errors it encounters in
       the allocation test, or to mark as allocated any unusable sectors  it
       encounters in the media test.
    
          If errors are encountered in either test, CHKDISK will prompt with
       'Write updated link table? '. Entering  'Y'  will  cause  CHKDISK  to
       write its updated link table  to  the  disk,  thereby  releasing  any
       misallocated sectors, and marking as busy any unusable sectors.
    
          The '/REBUILD' qualifier supresses the prompt, and causes  CHKDISK
       to update the disk link table if any errors were encountered.

       of them to one destination file.
    
          Unless the '/QUIET' qualifier is  specified,  CONCAT  reports  the
       total number of lines written.
    
          Only ASCII text files will  be  correctly  joined  by  the  CONCAT
       command.

          The CONNECT command  creates  a  logical  connection  between  the
       console device, and the specified  device.  Any  characters  received
       from that device will be sent to the console device.  All  characters
       except for the ESCAPE character which are entered at the console will
       be transmitted from the specified  device.  Entering  ESCAPE  at  the
       console terminates the connect command.
    
          On systems where the console device is an  integral  keyboard  and
       video display, CONNECT  provides  an  easy  way  to  emulate  a  dumb
       terminal.
    
          For external serial console devices, CONNECT is more often used as
       a "pass through" mechanism to access a communications medium such  as
       a modem or switched network.

                                  /REPLACE  - Replace files without prompt.
    
          The COPY command copies files from one location to another.
    
          The source file specification  may  contain  wildcards  ('*'),  in
       which case all files matching that pattern will be  copied.  Wildcard
       ('*') characters in the destination specification indicates  sections
       of the original name which are to be retained.
    
          If the destination filename  and  type  are  not  specified,  they
       default to '*', indicating the original file name and type.
    
          If the destination directory is not specified, it defaults to  the
       current default directory.
    
          The '/MOVE' qualifier causes copy to move  the  file,  instead  of
       copying it. For source and destination on the same disk, COPY  simply
       renames the file to the new directory  and  name.  For  locations  on
       different disks, COPY copies the file, then DELETE's the original.
    
          The '/NEW' qualifier prevents COPY  from  copying  or  moving  any
       files if the destination file already exists. If  this  qualifier  is
       not specified, COPY will prompt for the action to take. Enter 'R'  to
       replace the old file, 'C' to  change  the  name  of  the  file  being
       written, or 'S' to skip the file and  not  copy  it.  The  '/REPLACE'
       qualifier causes COPY to always replace existing files  specified  by
       the destination operand.
    
          Unless the '/QUIET' qualifier  is  specified,  COPY  displays  the
       names of all files it is copying.

          COPYDISK copies an entire disk to another disk.
    
          The disks must be the same size. COPYDISK will fail with the error
       message 'Incompatable drive sizes' unless this is true.
    
          The '/PROMPT' qualifier causes COPYDISK to prompt, allowing you to
       change the disks before the copy operation starts.
    
          If the source and destination are specified  as  the  same  drive,
       COPYDISK will prompt you to insert the source and destination  disks,
       allowing a disk copy to be performed on a single drive.
    
          Unless the '/QUIET' qualifier is specified, COPYDISK will output a
       running display of the operation  being  performed,  and  the  sector
       number that it is operating on.
    CREATE                                                          CREATE

            Qualifiers          : NONE
    
          The CREATE command creates a file with the specified name. If  the
       optional address value is specified, the file is  created  with  that
       load address. The created file is one block in size.
    
          The load address of a file is  stored  in  that  file's  directory
       entry, and specifies where in memory  the  file  will  be  loaded  in
       response to a "LOAD" command which does not specify  an  address.  In
       the case of an executable (.EXE) file, the  load  address  determines
       where in memory the file will be loaded when is is executed.
    
          The DOS will automatically create a file if an attempt is made  to
       write to a file which does not exist.  The  CREATE  command  is  used
       mainly to create files with a particular load address. CREATE is also
       useful from within command files,  because  it  will  fail  (non-zero
       return code) if the file it attempts to create already  exists.  This
       provides a method for ensuring that a  particular  command  does  not
       overwrite an existing file.
    DELETE                                                          DELETE

            Qualifiers          : NONE
    
          The DELETE command permanently removes a file from the disk.
    
          Any disk sectors used by the file will be released, allowing  them
       to be reused by other files.
    
          If <filespec> does not contain wildcard  characters,  DELETE  will
       simply delete the named file.
    
          If <filespec> does contain wildcard characters, the DELETE command
       will prompt with the name of each file it finds  which  matches  that
       pattern, allowing the following responses:
    
          Y - Delete the file and advance to the next one.
          N - Retain the file and advance to the next one.
          Q - Retain the file and terminate the delete command.
    
          A file will not  be  deleted  if  it  does  not  have  'D'  delete
       permission set in its protection string.
    DIR                                                                 DIR

                                              and total file counts.
                                  /NOHEADER - Suppress directory header.
                                  /PROT     - Include file protections.
    
          The DIR command displays the names of  files  on  the  disk  in  a
       format which is easier to read than that of the FILES command.
    
          The operand <dir spec> may be any directory or file  specification
       which is valid for the FILES command.
    
          The names to be shown are sorted and  displayed  as  well  as  the
       total number of files.
    DIRF                                                                DIRF

                                  /NOTYPE       - Don't include file type.
    
          The DIRF command produces a directory listing and writes it  to  a
       file. The directory listing is of similar format to that of the FILES
       command.
    
          The names of all files matching <pattern> are written one per line
       to the specified file.
    
          If the <prefix> is specified, it must be  enclosed  within  unique
       delimiter characters, and will be placed ahead of  each  filename  in
       the output file.
    
          If the <postfix> is specified, it must be enclosed  within  unique
       delimiter characters, and will be placed following each  filename  in
       the output file.
    
          The '/NODISK', '/NODIRECTORY' and '/NOTYPE' qualifiers may be used
       to suppress the corresponding portion of the filename from the output
       command.
    
          This command is very  useful  for  creating  command  files  which
       perform an operation on many files.
    
                EG: "DIRF SETEXE.@ *.EXE 'SET FILE ' ' PROT=E'"

          The DOWNLOAD  command  accepts  a  standard  Motorola  hexidecimal
       format load file from the specified serial device, and loads it  into
       memory at the address contained in the load records of the file.
    
          If the optional filename is specified, DOWNLOAD  also  writes  the
       memory image to that file.
    
          If the specified file does not already exist, it will be  created,
       and the load address will be set to  the  address  contained  in  the
       first load record in the download file.
    
          DOWNLOAD provides an easy method up updating system software  over
       a remote serial link.

          EDIT is a simple line oriented text editor. It is used  to  create
       and edit disk files containing ASCII text. While editing a file, EDIT
       prompts with '.', and has the following commands available:
    
            B               - Go to beginning of file.
        1   C/<s1>/<s2>/    - Substitute <s2> for <s1> on current line.

        1)  '/' may be any unique delimiter character not appearing within
            <s1> or <s2>. Trailing '/' is optional.
    
        2)  The value of <n> defaults to one (1) if no value is given.
    
        3)  The restored position may move if lines are inserted, changed,
            or deleted above the saved position.
    
        4)  The given string is inserted at the end of the input line
            (Including the carriage return) whenever ESC key is pressed.
    
          When the '/BATCH' qualifier is given, EDIT  will  read  its  input
       commands (and text) from the file specified by  <command  file>.  The
       '/QUIET' qualifier can be used to prevent the  editing  session  from
       being displayed.

       supports both line and visual (screen) oriented modes  of  operation,
       and has many powerful commands.
    
          When operating  in  visual  mode,  EDT  uses  the  standard  "TTY"
       interface, allowing the "TTYPATCH" utility to be used to  define  the
       terminal control codes and functon keys used.

          If <filespec> is a directory prefix, then all  files  having  that
       directory prefix are displayed.
    
          If the operand is a full file  specification  (which  may  contain
       wildcards), FILES displays the names of all files on the  disk  which
       match that pattern.
    
          If no operand is given, the names of all  files  in  your  current
       default directory are displayed.

            Qualifiers          : /UNLINK   - Unlink file from directory.
    
          The FLINK command creates one or more directory entries  with  the
       given name(s), which are linked to the disk data of the  first  file.
       This has the effect of making one file accessable by  multiple  names
       (Perhaps in different directories, or with different load address  or
       protections).
    
          Care MUST be taken to never DELETE  a  file  which  is  linked  to
       another file, because the data area (used by all linked files) on the
       disk will be released, and all other linked directory  entries  would
       be left pointing to unallocated (or worse reused) file system space.
    
          The CHKDISK utility will report an allocation error  for  all  but
       one of the linked files. This occurs because CHKDISK goes through the
       motions of deleting all files (without  actually  deleting  them)  in
       order to determine that all sectors that are allocated  an  the  disk
       are actually used within files.
    
          When the '/UNLINK' qualifier is used, FLINK removes the  directory
       entries for  all  named  files,  WITHOUT  releasing  the  data  space
       allocated to them. This allows the multiple directory entries created
       by FLINK to be removed leaving the disk data intact  for  other  file
       links.
    
          FLINK/UNLINK may also be used to get rid of  a  file  in  which  a
       known bad sector exists, thereby insuring that those sectors will not
       be re-used.
    
          The CHKDISK utility can be used to recover disk sectors accidently
       lost by unlinking a file with no other directory entries pointing  to
       it.
    
          If a linked file is accidently deleted, use CHKDISK  to  determine
       the names of the other links, and then FLINK/UNLINK to  remove  those
       entries.

          The FORMAT command formats the specified disk, and creates a  file
       system on it. After displaying the selected parameter  settings,  the
       FORMAT command prompts with  'Ok?'.  Entering  'Y'  will  format  and
       initialize the disk. 'N' cancels the command.
    
          All disks used on the system must be formatted before use.
    
          The CYLINDERS= parameter specifies the number of  cylinders  which
       are to be formatted on the disk.
    
          The DIRECTORY=  parameter  specifies  the  number  of  extra  disk
       sectors which are to be allocated  to  the  directory  on  the  disk.
       Although the directory is automatically extended when more  directory
       space is needed, creating the disk  with  a  large  enough  directory
       keeps that directory in one place at  the  start  of  the  disk,  and
       reduces the amount of disk activity needed to  access  files.  If  no
       DIRECTORY= parameter is specified, three extra sectors  (four  total)

          The ADDRESS= parameter specifies the physical  device  address  of
       the drive to be formatted.

          FORTH is an implementation of the FORTH language. This version  of
       FORTH is unique in that  it  compiles  to  directly  executable  6809
       machine code, instead of the  usual  intermediate  interpreted  code.
       This results in much faster execution  than  is  possible  with  most
       FORTH systems.

          The HELP command, will display the  selections  in  the  requested
       help library, and will prompt for topics  and  subtopics,  displaying
       the help information associated  with  each  item  selected.  If  the
       response to a topic or subtopic prompt contains more than  one  word,
       HELP will assume the subsequent words to be additional subtopics.
    
          A list of topics/subtopics may be given to HELP as parameters, and
       will be processed as if they were entered in response to  a  'Topic?'
       prompt. Help will accept a '?' in response to a prompt, which  causes
       it to re-display the text associated with that prompt. A  null  line,
       entered as a response to  a  prompt,  causes  HELP  to  back  up  one
       subtopic level, and prompt again. If help is given  a  null  line  in
       response to the 'Topic?' prompt, HELP will terminate.
    
          A CONTROL-C entered in response to any prompt, will cause HELP  to
       terminate.
    
          Help will accept a library name, as a qualifier, denoted by  using
       the slash '/' character. If this is given, HELP will look for a  file
       with the name [HELP]<library name>.HLP, and will use it as the source
       of help information. If no  help  library  name  is  specified,  HELP
       assumes the default help library '[HELP]SYSTEM.HLP'.
    
          A list of the available HELP libraries can be obtained  by  typing
       'HELP/'.

          HEXED is a screen oriented hexadecimal file patch utility. It uses
       the "TTY" screen interface, which allows it to be customized with the
       "TTYPATCH" utility for use on any terminal.
    
          HEXED displays a 256 byte portion of the file  in  HEX/ASCII  dump
       format, and allows either the HEXADECIMAL  or  ASCII  display  to  be
       edited.
    
          When the cursor is positioned in the HEXADECIMAL  display,  typing
       two HEX characters will update the value under the cursor and advance
       to the next byte.
    
          When the cursor is positioned in the  ASCII  display,  typing  any
       ASCII character will replace  the  character  under  the  cursor  and
       advance to the next byte.
    
          The following special keys are recognized by HEXED:
    
            UP ARROW    - Move cursor up.
            DOWN ARROW  - Move cursor down.
            RIGHT ARROW - Move cursor to the right.
            LEFT ARROW  - Move cursor to the left.
            PAGE UP     - Display preceeding 256 bytes.
            PAGE DOWN   - Display following 256 bytes.
            HOME        - Go directly to the start of the file.
            END         - Go directly to the end of the file.
            F1          - Execute line mode command.
            F2          - Re-execute last line mode command.
            F3          - Toggle between HEXADECIMAL and ASCII fields.
    
          The following line mode commands are available:
    
            G<xxxx>     - Goto position <xxxx> in file.
            Q           - Quit editing session and return to dos.
            QQ          - Quit even if unsaved changes are present.
            W           - Write file and save changes.
            ?<string>   - Search forward for ASCII <string>.
            /<xx> <xx>..- Search forward for HEX byte values.

          The  INTIO  utility  installs  a  temporary  device  driver  which
       performs buffered interrupt driven input from the serial device. This
       allows the the system to receive serial data at much  higher  speeds,
       and supports XON/XOFF flow control for both receive and transmit data
       streams.
    
          The '/OFF' qualifier removes a previously installed interrupt  I/O
       driver. No other parameters are required when using this qualifier.
    
          INTIO is a hardware  dependant  utility  which  may  vary  between
       systems.

          The LDIR command lists the names of all directories  on  the  disk
       which contain files matching the specified pattern.
    
          If the pattern specified does not contain  an  explicit  directory
       prefix it defaults to '[*]', which shows all directories that have  a
       matching file.
    
          If the pattern specified does not contain an explicit filename and
       type, it defaults to '*.*', which shows the  directory  if  any  file
       exists with that prefix.

          The LOAD command loads the specified file from disk to  memory  at
       the specified address. If no address is specified, the file is loaded
       at its load address, as indicated by its directory entry.
    
          The file is BLOCK loaded, so a multiple of 512 bytes  of  data  is
       always transferred.

          MAPL (Micro APL) is an interactive computer language  which  is  a
       subset of the APL language. MAPL  has  it's  own  library  system  of
       workspaces,  and  supports  user  defined  functions  and  variables,
       recursion, and many of the basic operators from  APL.  MAPL  supports
       integer and character types.
    
          Unlike APL, MAPL does not require a  special  terminal,  but  uses
       normal upper and lower case ASCII characters to  represent  the  many
       special operators.
    
          For more information, consult the MAPL manual.
    MOVEAPL                                                             MOVEAPL

          The MOVEAPL command is used to change the RAM load  address  of  a
       MAPL workspace file. This must be done before you can  use  the  MAPL
       workspace on a system with a different memory map  from  the  one  on
       which it was created.
    
          In addition to changing the load  address  of  the  file,  MOVEAPL
       adjusts the symbol table pointers in the workspace to reflect the new
       load address of each variable or function.
    
          The correct load address for a particular system may be determined
       by examining the load address of the MAPL.EXE image in  the  [SYSTEM]
       directory, and adding an 8K ($2000) offset to it.

          RAID (Runtime Aid for Interactive Debugging) is  a  program  which
       aids in the debugging process, by allowing the user  to  monitor  and
       control the execution of a program under test.
    
          RAID  includes  a  full  6809  disassembler  and   contains   code
       breakpoint and software single step facilities.
    
          The  '/<dev>'  qualifier  causes  RAID  to  communicate  with  the
       specified serial device (0-7)  for  the  duration  of  the  debugging
       session. If no device is specified, RAID assumes the current  console
       device.
    
          If <filename> is specified,  RAID  loads  the  file  at  its  load
       address, sets the program counter to that  address,  points  the  'Y'
       register to the remainder of the command line  allowing  the  program
       under test to receive its operands, and then begins  the  interactive
       debugging session, prompting with 'Raid>'.
    
          If no operands are  given,  RAID  simply  enters  the  interactive
       debugging session.
    
          When it is first invoked, RAID attaches itself to the DOS in  such
       a way that RAID becomes essential for the DOS to operate. If RAID  is
       terminated in any abnormal way, it is advisable to reboot DOS.
    
          For more information, consult the RAID manual.

          The READ command reads disk sectors from the specified drive,  and
       places them in memory at the specified  address.  If  <size>  is  not
       specified, one sector is transferred.
    
          The READ command bypasses the normal DOS file system,  and  should
       only be used by persons  familiar  with  the  disk  structure  during
       recovery procedures. It is not intended that  READ  be  used  in  the
       normal every day operation of the system.

                                  /WRITE    - Redirect writes to device
    
          The REDIRECT utility installs  a  temporary  device  driver  which
       causes accesses to the specified serial device to be redirected to  a
       file.
    
          The '/WRITE' qualifier causes redirect to operate on writes to the
       device. Any characters sent to the device  will  be  written  to  the
       named file.
    
          The '/ALL' qualifier causes redirect to write all control codes to
       the file exactly as they are sent to the device. If this qualifier is
       not given, lines of data are written to the file with only a carriage
       return separator, thereby creating a standard text file.
    
          If the '/WRITE' qualifier is not given, redirect operates on reads
       of the device. Each request to read a character from the device  will
       return the next character from the file. When the end of the file  is
       encountered, the next read will indicate that no character is  ready,
       after which the original device driver will be restored.
    
          The '/CLOSE' quailfier is used to terminate a  previously  invoked
       REDIRECT. No other parameters are required with this qualifier.
    
          If no <device>  parameter  is  given,  REDIRECT  operates  on  the
       current console device.

          The RETURN command is used to return to an  application  that  has
       temporarily entered the dos via a system call.
    
          When an application program enters the dos this way, only internal
       commands  and  utility  programs  should  be  run.   If   any   other
       applications  are  executed,  the  original   application   will   be
       terminated.

          The RUn command loads the specified file into memory at  its  load
       address and executes it. The file type '.EXE' is assumed.
    
          The indicated file (with the name <pgmname>.EXE)  is  loaded  into
       memory at its Load address, and execution is  transferred  to  offset
       zero (0) within that code.
    
          The remainder of  the  command  line  is  made  available  to  the
       executing program so that parameters can be evaluated.

                                  /HEX      - Search string is in hex.
                                  /TOTAL    - Display only total found.
    
          The SEARCH utility scans specified files, and displays a  list  of
       the occurrences of the given search string. Wildcard ('*') characters
       may be specified in the <filespec> operand. The search string may  be
       delimited by any character which is not part  of  the  actual  search
       string.
    
          If the '/BINARY' qualifier is given, SEARCH treats the input  file
       as a binary file. The $FF end of file character used  in  ASCII  text
       files will be treated as data, and SEARCH will scan all  the  way  to
       the end of the last sector of  the  file.  The  output  display  will
       contain only the offset into the file when this qualifier is used.
    
          If the '/CASE' qualifier is given, SEARCH will convert  any  lower
       case characters from the input file into upper case before doing  the
       comparison. This allows case insensitive searches to be performed.
          NOTE: If the SEARCH command is used from DOS interactive mode, any
       lower case characters in the search string will be converted to upper
       case.
    
          The '/HEX' qualifier indicates to SEARCH that the search string is
       being given as a series of  hexidecimal  values.  No  delimiters  are
       needed when this qualifier is used.
    
          The '/TOTAL' qualifier causes SEARCH to only output the  names  of
       the files being searched, and the total number of occurrences of  the
       search string in each file.

          SIM80 is an application program which simulates the  execution  of
       an Intel 8080 microprocessor, by interpreting the  opcodes  it  reads
       from memory.
    
          SIM80 loads the 8080 code file at its  load  address,  and  begins
       interpreting at offset zero (0) within that image. The filetype '.80'
       is assumed.
    
          If the '/DEBUG' qualifier is given, SIM80 enters its resident 8080
       debugger, after the image is loaded.

          STTY  is  a  utility  which  sets  the  options  for  the   serial
       communications devices. This is a system specific  utility,  and  the
       implementation of parameters to the right of the  device  number  may
       vary, depending on the hardware in use.
    
          The standard STTY which functions with 6551 uart devices  has  the
       following options available:
    
          SPEED= is used to set the baudrate of the serial device. The value
       of <baud rate> must be one of: 50, 75, 110,  134.5,  150,  300,  600,
       1200, 1800, 2400, 3600, 4800, 7200, 9600 or 19200.
    
          PARITY= specifies the parity type, and must be one of: ODD,  EVEN,
       MARK, SPACE or NONE.
    
          BITS= specifies the number of bits per character, and must be  one
       of: 5, 6, 7 or 8.
    
          STOP= specifies the number of stop bits transmitted at the end  of
       each character, and must be one of: 1 or 2.
    
          If only the device number is given, STTY will display the  current
       settings for that device.

          The TTYPATCH utliity provides  the  capability  of  modifying  the
       terminal control codes and  function  keys  used  by  certain  screen
       oriented application programs. Any application which uses  the  "TTY"
       interface library to control  the  terminal  may  be  modified  using
       "TTYPATCH".
    
          TTYPATCH operates using a line by line menu interface, allowing it
       to be used regardless of the terminal type.
    
          Any terminal may be used for screen applications, provided that it
       has the following features:
    
          1) Absolute cursor positioning
          2) Clear entire screen
          3) Clear to end of line
          4) Clear to end of display
          5) One special video mode (reverse etc)

          The TYPE utility displays the contents of a file, a  disk  sector,
       or of main memory. The data is displayed as ASCII  text,  unless  the
       '/DUMP'  qualiifer  is  given,  in  which  case  it  is   output   in
       Hexidecimal/ASCII dump format.
    
          If the '/DISK' qualifier is given, the operand is  a  disk  sector
       number, and TYPE will display the contents of that sector as well  as
       any sectors linked to it in the disk link table.
    
          If the '/MEMORY' qualifier is  given,  the  operand  is  a  memory
       address, and TYPE will display the contents of  memory,  starting  at
       that address.
    
          If neither the '/DISK' or  '/MEMORY'  qualifiers  are  found,  the
       operand is a file name, and TYPE displays the contents of that file.
    
          The '/PAGE' qualifier causes TYPE to halt the display after  every
       twenty two lines of output, and wait for a keypress from the  console
       before proceding.
    
          If the <device> number is specified, TYPE outputs to  that  serial
       device. Otherwise, output is sent to the console device.
    
          When displaying text files, TYPE  expands  tab  characters  to  an
       appriopriate number of spaces assuming eight character tab stops.
