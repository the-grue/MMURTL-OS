    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          The CUBIX operating system is designed to be ported at the  object
       (minor port), or source code (major port) level.
    
          A minor port may be performed whenever the target system  conforms
       to the standard CUBIX memory map. The development system used must be
       capable of linking a ROMable image. This memory map is as follows:
    
            $0000-$1FFF - I/O devices (Incl. memory mapped video etc).
            $2000-$DFFF - Random Access Memory.
            $E000-$FFFF - CUBIX Operating System ROM
    
          A minor port is accomplished  by  writing  the  I/O  drivers,  and
       linking those drivers into the CUBIX image.  The  system  application
       and utility programs are provided on a CUBIX format 5.25"  disk,  and
       are ready to use.
    
          A minor port may also be performed from a CUBIX distribution  ROM,
       as described in the section on ROM porting.
    
          A major port is required  whenever  the  target  system  does  not
       conform to the above memory map, or the develoment system  used  does
       not have the capability to link absolute location ROMable images.
    
          A major port is accomplished  by  writing  the  I/O  drivers,  and
       including them in the CUBIX operating system source  code,  which  is
       then assembled into a ROMable image. The  memory  addresses  used  by
       CUBIX may be altered at this time.
    
          The  system  application  and  utility  programs  must   also   be
       assembled, to properly locate them in the target system memory map.
    
          In all cases, CUBIX is placed in an 8K (2764 or similar)  ROM  and
       placed at the top of the 6809 memory map (Locations $E000 to  $FFFF).
       The CHECKSUM of the rom must be stored as a 16 bit value in the first
       two rom locations.
    
          The ROM CHECKSUM is calculated as the 16 bit  sum  of  all  8  bit
       values from offset $0002 to the end of the rom (Offset  $1FFF).  This
       16 bit checksum must be stored in the rom with the  most  signifigant
       byte at offset $0000, and the least signifigant byte at offset $0001.

    2. HARDWARE INITIALIZATION
    
          The I/O  drivers  must  include  a  routine  called  HWINIT  which
       establishes the CUBIX system default parameters, initializes hardware
       devices, installs all device drivers, and prepares  the  console  for
       the CUBIX startup messages.
    
       2.1 Initializing CUBIX
    
             When HWINIT is called, the 6809 'Y' register is set to point to
          an internal table which must be filled in by HWINIT. The format of
          this table is as follows:
    
    OSRAM   EQU        *        Address of OS initialized ram (passed in 'Y').
            RMB        7        Default DCB for drive A
            RMB        7        Default DCB for drive B
            RMB        7        Default DCB for drive C
            RMB        7        Default DCB for drive D
            RMB        1        Default console input device (0-7)

            RMB        2        IRQ  handler vector address
            RMB        2        FIRQ handler vector address
            RMB        2        NMI  handler vector address
            RMB        1        Error messages enabled flag
            RMB        1        SSR Debug enabled flag
            RMB        1        Command file trace enabled flag
            RMB        1        Default drive (0-3)
            RMB        8        Default directory prefix
            RMB        1        System drive (0-3)
            RMB        8        System directory prefix
    
    Notes  1) CYL, HEAD, and SEC values of DCB's should be set to zero.
           2) Default console input device is usually 1
           3) Unused serial device drivers should be set to zero.
           4) SWI vector should be set to execute the CUBIX SSR handler,
              which is located at address $E00B.
           5) Unused SWI2, SWI3, IRQ, FIRQ, NMI vectors should point
              to an 'RTI' instruction.
           6) Usual settings of ERROR, TRACE and DEBUG are $FF, 0, 0.
              ($FF = ENABLED, 0 = DISABLED).
           7) Drives are offset zero ('A'=0, 'B'=1, 'C'=2, 'D'=3).
           8) Unused portions of directory prefix's should be padded with
              zeros to the right.

       2.2 Initializing Hardware Devices
    
             HWINIT  must  initialize  the  hardware  in  the  system,  this
          includes such things as the disk drive controller, serial devices,
          video displays, and any other devices which must be available  for
          CUBIX to operate.
    
       2.3 Initializing the Console
    
             For systems using a serial  terminal  as  the  console,  HWINIT
          should output a line feed, and  carraige  return  to  the  console
          device to establish the cursor at the left hand margin.
    
             For systems using an integrated memory  mapped  video  display,
          HWINIT should perform a  clear  screen  operation,  and  home  the
          cursor.
    
    3. SERIAL DEVICE DRIVERS
    
          The serial device drivers installed by HWINIT are free to use  the
       6809 'B' and 'X' registers without saving them. When  the  driver  is
       called, the  'B'  register  will  contain  the  CUBIX  device  number
       multiplied by two.
    
       3.1 Input Drivers
    
             Input device drivers should  test  for  a  character  from  the
          device, and return with the character in the 'A' register, and the
          'Z' condition flag set if a character was found. If  no  character
          is found, the 'A' register should be loaded with $FF, and the  'Z'
          flag cleared.
    
       3.2 Output Drivers
    
             Output drivers should write the character passed  in  the  6809
          'A' register to the device. It should not return  until  this  has
          been done.
    
       3.3 NULL Device Driver
    
             The NULL DEVICE (device 0) drivers are  easily  implemented  as
          follows:
    
                RDNULL  LDA     #$FF    INDICATE NO CHARACTER READY
                WRNULL  RTS             RETURN TO CALLER
    
       3.4 Similar Devices
    
             When several similar devices are available, the device  drivers
          usually load the 6809 'X' register with the address of the device,
          and then jump to a common handler.
    
             The  standard  'STTY'  utility  supplied  with   CUBIX,   which
          functions with 6551 uarts, examines the first instruction  of  the
          input driver, looking for an 'LDX' instruction, from which it  can
          determine the address of the device.
    CUBIX System Porting Guide                                       Page: 4


             If no 'LDX' is found, STTY aborts with the error message:
    
                    'Device has fixed comunication format.'
    
    4. DISK DEVICE DRIVERS
    
          The disk drivers installed by HWINIT are free to use the 'A', 'B',
       'X' and 'Y' registers without saving them. When a routine is invoked,
       the 6809 'U' register will be set to point to the drive control block
       (DCB). See the CUBIX system programming guide for  a  description  of
       the DCB.
    
          If an operation is unsuccessful, the  disk  driver  should  return
       with the 'Z' flag  cleared,  and  a  value  in  the  'A'  accumulator
       indicating the proper error message to display as follows:
    
                 0 - 'Disk system error'
                 1 - 'Disk format error'
                 2 - 'Bad sector'
                 3 - 'Sector not found'
                 4 - 'Disk write protected'
    
          If 'A' is set to any other value, it is treated as zero (0).
    
          The following disk routines are required:
    
       4.1 Home head
    
             The  home  routine  resets  the  head  of  the  physical  drive
          indicated in the DCB to track zero.
    
       4.2 Read a sector
    
             The read routine reads sector (512 bytes) indicated by the CYL,
          HEAD and SEC entries in the DCB from the indicated physical drive,
          and places it in memory at the address passed in the 'X' register.
          The routine must perform a seek operation to position the head  to
          the correct cylinder. If a read error occurs, the  routine  should
          simply return with an error code. The operating system  will  call
          this routine up to five times to retry in case  of  errors.  After
          the third retry, the home routine will be  called  to  recalibrate
          the head.
    
       4.3 Write a sector
    
             The write routine writes a sector (512 bytes) indicated by  the
          CYL, HEAD and SEC entries in the DCB  to  the  indicated  physical
          drive, from memory at the address  passed  in  the  'X'  register.
          Seeking and retry operation is the same as  for  the  read  sector
          routine described above.
    
       4.4 Format a disk
    
             The format routine formats the disk in the  indicated  physical
          drive with the  number  of  cylinders,  heads,  and  sectors/track
          indicated by the NCYL, NHEAD, and NSEC  values  in  the  DCB.  The
          sector Interleave factor is passed in the 6809 'A' register.

    5. STTY UTILITY
    
          The complete source for  the  standard  CUBIX  'STTY'  utility  is
       provided in the EXAMPLES  directory.  This  routine  is  designed  to
       function with 6551 type uart devices, and may be modified  to  handle
       the serial devices in the target system.
    
    6. INTIO UTILITY
    
          The complete source for the  standard  CUBIX  'INTIO'  utility  is
       provided in the EXAMPLES  directory.  This  routine  is  designed  to
       function with 6551 type uarts, and assumes a  common  interrupt  line
       from all uart IRQ outputs to the 6809  IRQ  input.  If  the  standard
       serial device drivers do not  support  interrupt  I/O,  this  utility
       should be modified to operate in  the  hardware  environment  of  the
       target system.
    
    7. TERMINAL HANDLING
    
          The  TTYPATCH  utility  is  provided  to   modify   the   terminal
       charactistics of screen oriented programs such as  the  'EDT'  screen
       editor. See the 'TTY' manual, and the 'TTYPATCH' documentation in the
       CUBIX users guide for details.

    8. MAJOR PORTS
    
          When performng a MAJOR port of  the  CUBIX  system,  you  will  be
       provided with "porting" source files for the operating system and its
       utilities. The "porting" sources have all comments stripped out,  and
       all symbols which do not need to be modified as part of the port  are
       changed to meanless alphabetic sequences.
    
          The "porting" sources have been made purposly difficult to modify,
       in order to minimize the alterations to  CUBIX,  and  subsequent  non
       standard releases. Please resist  the  temptation,  as  compatability
       must be maintained between CUBIX releases  in  order  for  it  to  be
       successful.
    
       8.1 Operating System
    
             The following symbols must be set in the CUBIX  "MAIN"  source,
          to adapt it to the system memory map.
    
             The symbol 'ROM' must be set to the  starting  address  of  the
          system ROM (8K rom is required). The ROM  must  control  the  6809
          vectors which are located at the top of the memory map at  address
          $FFF2. The usual address of 'ROM' is $E000.
    
             The symbol 'RAM' points to a 1K block of memory which  is  used
          by CUBIX for internal variables, buffers and stack. It is  usually
          set to the top 1K of Random Access Memory, which is $DC00  in  the
          standard system.
    
             The symbol 'USRRAM' points to the lowest memory  address  which
          is available for general use. It set  to  $2000  in  the  standard
          system.
    
             The symbol 'USREND' indicates the highest memory address  which
          is to be tested by the startup memory test. It is usually  set  to
          RAM+1023, but is available separatly in  case  OS  memory  is  not
          contiguous with application memory.
    
             The driver routines should  be  included  in  the  source  file
          immediatly preceding the 6809 hardware vectors  (ORG  $FFF2)  near
          the end of the file.
    CUBIX System Porting Guide                                       Page: 7


       8.2 Applications and Utilities
    
             All application and utility programs must be assembled  to  fit
          the memory map of the system. A 'macros' file  is  provided  which
          must be included at  the  beginning  of  each  source  file.  This
          provides the 'SSR' macro which implements the CUBIX System Service
          Request instruction. This macro must  be  modified  to  suit  your
          particular macro assembler. Also provided in the 'macros' file are
          the following symbols used by the application and utility sources.
    
             The symbol 'OSRAM' must be set to  the  lowest  memory  address
          which is available for general use. Is it  set  to  $2000  in  the
          standard system
    
             The symbol 'OSEND' must be set to the  highest  memory  address
          which is available for general use. It is  set  to  $DBFF  in  the
          standard system.
    
             The symbol 'OSUTIL' indicates the top three Kbytes  of  general
          use memory. This  is  the  location  reserved  for  CUBIX  utility
          programs which may be executed from within an application.  It  is
          set to $D000 in the standard system.
    
             The following the a sample 'macros' file  which  is  compatable
          with the my XASM Development Tools macro processor  and  assembler
          (ASM09).
    
            OSRAM   EQU    $2000       APPLICATION RAM AREA
            OSEND   EQU    $DBFF       END OF GENERAL RAM
            OSUTIL  EQU    $D000       UTILITY ADDRESS SPACE

            *
            * This is not needed if using CUBIX's own assembler,
            * since it has an internal 'SSR' directive.

    9. PORTING FROM ROM (MINOR PORT)
    
          A minor port may be performed directly from a  CUBIX  distribution
       ROM. This ROM contains only the operating system  code,  without  the
       I/O drivers.
    
          When performing a system port from a  ROM,  the  distribution  rom
       should first be copied, and all changes made on the copy. This leaves
       the master rom unchanged and safe from accidental damage.
    
          The first few locations in the distribution rom have the following
       contents:
    
        E000 FF FF       CHKSUM FDB     $FFFF   CHECKSUM GOES HERE
        E002 10 00       MBASE  FDB     $2000   BASE RAM ADDRESS
        E004 10 8E ?? ?? INIT   LDY     #IRAM   POINT TO INITIALIZED RAM
        E008 BD XX XX           JMP     HWINIT  EXECUTE USER INIT. ROUTINE
        E00B XX XX XX    SSR    EQU     *       SSR HANDLER ROUTINE
    
          The 16 bit value at offset 0 (Address $E000) must be  set  to  the
       checksum of the ROM, which is the sixteen bit sum of all  ROM  memory
       locations from $E002 (Offset 2) to $FFFF (Offset 8191). This checksum
       must be calculated AFTER the drivers  are  installed  AND  any  other
       modifications to the ROM contents have been are completed.
    
          The 16 bit value at offset 2 (Address  $E002)  identifies  to  the
       operating system the lowest available RAM location. This is  used  to
       determinate where to begin the memory test, and for the default  load
       address of CREATE'd files.
    
          The 'JMP' instruction at offset 8 (Address  $E008)  addresses  the
       user supplied 'HWINIT' routine. In the distribution ROM,  this  jumps
       to the first free memory location in the ROM following the  operating
       system code. The address  of  this  location  can  be  determined  by
       reading the address from the 'JMP' instruction which is at  offset  9
       and 10 (Address $E009 and $E00A) in the ROM.
    
          The I/O drivers should be assembled and placed  into  the  rom  at
       this address, with the HWINIT routine being the first routine so that
       it will be properly entered when the 'JMP'  executes.  All  remaining
       rom space  up  to  the  6809  hardware  vectors  (Address  $FFF2)  is
       available for use by the driver routines.
    
          Since the operating system accesses all other driver routines only
       via the table filled in by 'HWINIT', only 'HWINIT' must be placed  at
       a known location (As determined earlier).
    
          The 'SWI' vector filled in the the HWINIT routine should be set to
       point to the SSR handler which begins at address $E00B.
    
          If the base (lowest) ram location of the target system is not  the
       CUBIX standard ($2000), the application and  utility  programs  which
       load at the bottom of ram will have to be re-generated to reflect the
       new load address (Partial MAJOR port).

       9.1 Porting from an existing system ROM
    
             The CUBIX system may be ported from  any  existing  CUBIX  ROM,
          provided that the location of the ROM, and the highest RAM address
          are the same in the existing and  target  systems.  This  will  be
          $E000 and $DFFF in most systems.
    
             Ports for systems in which the ROM location or the highest  RAM
          address differs from the above must be performed by  re-generating
          the CUBIX image with the new memory map (MAJOR port).
    
             If the base (lowest) RAM location  differs  from  the  existing
          system to the target system, the application and utility  programs
          which load at the bottom of ram will have to  be  re-generated  to
          reflect the new load address (Partial MAJOR port).
    
       9.2 Applications and Utilities
    
             If you have the CUBIX version of the minor  port  package,  you
          will have a CUBIX format disk containing the  system  applications
          and utilities. In this case, the programs are ready to go, and you
          may use them directly from the disk.
    
             The HOST version of the  CUBIX  minor  port  package  does  not
          include a CUBIX format disk, but instead has the  ".HEX"  download
          files for each of the CUBIX system programs.
    
             Once you have ported the CUBIX rom, you may use it to format  a
          disk,  and  download  the  system  software.  For  information  on
          FORMATTING and DOWNLOADING, see the CUBIX user guide.

    10. SAMPLE I/O DRIVERS
    
          The EAMPLES directory contains a sample source  file  for  a  very
       simple set of CUBIX device drivers. The drivers are fully functional,
       and require minimum hardware support  (ie:  no  interrupts  are  used
       etc).
    
          This system has two 6551 serial uart devices, and a NEC  765  type
       floppy disk controller. The 6551 drivers are  fully  compatable  with
       the standard STTY and INTIO utilities (Also provided in EXAMPLES).
    
          The two 6551 uarts occur in the 6809 memory map at addresses $0000
       and $0100. For simplicity in this example,  the  serial  I/O  drivers
       operate by software polling the uart. However, the IRQ  outputs  from
       the 6551's would normally be connected in a wired OR configuration to
       the 6809 IRQ input, allowing the INTIO utility to used. In a more I/O
       intensive system, it may be desirable to directly implement interrupt
       driven serial drivers.
    
          The floppy disk controller is  a  NEC  765  or  compatible,  which
       controls up to 4 standard 40 track single or  double  sided  diskette
       drives. Like the serial I/O drivers, all operations are performed  by
       software polling. The 765 is  accessed  at  address  $0200,  and  its
       TERMINAL COUNT pin is pulsed by reading or writing at address $0300.
