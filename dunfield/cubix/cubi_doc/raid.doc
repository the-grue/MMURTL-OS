    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          RAID is an interactive debugging facility for  the  motorola  6809
       microprocessor. It contains display/alter memory/register facilities,
       as well as a full 6809 disassembler, breakpoint, and software  single
       step functions. Download and transparent communication modes are also
       included.
    
          The format of the RAID command is as follows:
    
                         'RAID/[<device>] [<filename>]'
    
          If <filename> is specified, RAID first loads that file,  and  sets
       its saved program  counter  (PC)  to  its  starting  address.  If  no
       <filename> is given, raid goes directly to it's 'RAID>'  prompt,  and
       awaits your commands.
    
          If the '/<device>' qualifier is given, RAID communicates with  the
       specified serial device (0-7). IF not given, RAID assumes the current
       console device. Note  that  once  RAID  has  been  invoked,  it  will
       continue to communicate via the device that was console at  the  time
       that  it  was  started,  even  if  the  DOS  console  assignment   is
       subsequently changed.
    
          RAID operates on each command character as soon as  it  is  typed,
       there is no need to press return following command entry.  Note  that
       all hex values must be entered as two or four digits.

    2. USING RAID
    
       2.1 RAID Commands
    
             The following commands are implemented in RAID:
    
               B <breakpoint#> <address>
    
                  Set breakpoint at specified address. Breakpoint is removed
                  if address is 0000. There can be up to eight  breakpoints,
                  which are referenced by the numbers 0 to 7.
    
               C <register> <value>
    
                  Changes  6809  registers  values.  Register  is  a  single
                  character, which may be as follows:
    
               A   - Set A accumulator (8 bit value).
               B   - Set B accumulator (8 bit value).
               C   - Set condition code register (8 bit value).
               D   - Set direct page register (8 bit value).
               X   - Set X register (16 bit value).
               Y   - Set Y register (16 bit value).
               U   - Set user stack pointer (16 bit value).
               S   - Set system stack pointer (16 bit value).
               P   - Set program counter (16 bit value).
               sp  - (space) Set D accumulator (16 bit value).
    
               D <start>,<end>
    
                  Disassembles memory, starting  at  indicated  address.  If
                  space  is  entered  for  <end>  address,   assumes   FFFF.
                  Disassembler output contains address, opcodes bytes, ASCII
                  equivalent of  opcode  bytes,  instruction  neumonic,  and
                  operands  to  instruction.  Disassembler  output  can   be
                  aborted by pressing the <ESC> key. The line feed  key  may
                  be used to suspend output to the screen, after which  each
                  time line feed is pressed, one  additional  line  will  be
                  output. Pressing  the  carriage  return  key  will  resume
                  normal output.
    
               E <address>
    
                  Edit's memory, Address and contents are  displayed,  Enter
                  two hex digits to change value, or a single quote followed
                  by a  character.  Entering  a  space  skips  to  the  next
                  location, Backspace  backups  to  the  previous  location.
                  Carriage return terminates the edit command.
    
               G <address>
    
                  Begins execution at the indicated address. If a  space  is
                  entered instead on an address,  begins  execution  at  the
                  address in the saved 6809 program counter.
    RAID                                                             Page: 3


               M <start>,<end>
    
                  Displays memory, in HEX/ASCII dump format, starting at the
                  indicated  address.  If  a  space  is  entered  for  <end>
                  address, assumes FFFF. The output of  the  memory  command
                  can be aborted by pressing the <ESC> key,  line  feed  and
                  carriage return may be used to suspend output.
    
               R
    
                  Displays the values of the 6809 registers.
    
               S <address>
    
                  Begins single-stepping at  the  indicated  address.  If  a
                  space is entered for  the  address,  then  single-stepping
                  begins at the address in the saved 6809  program  counter.
                  Disassembled instruction is displayed on the terminal, and
                  RAID waits for a key to be pressed. If a space is entered,
                  steps to the next instruction. Carriage return toggles the
                  automatic display of registers. '?' displays the  register
                  values, and escape terminates the single-step command.
    
               V
    
                  Displays the current breakpoint settings.

       2.2 Breakpoints
    
             RAID allows breakpoints to be placed in the program under test,
          which when encountered during the execution of that program, cause
          the program to interrupt, and  RAID  is  entered.  Up  to  8  such
          breakpoints (numbered from 0 to 7) may be placed in the program at
          any one time.
             When entered from a  breakpoint,  RAID  will  first  display  a
          message  indicating  the  number  of  the  breakpoint  which   was
          encountered, and then enter command mode.
             Once RAID has been entered from a breakpoint, the registers  of
          the program under test are saved. Note that  the  address  of  the
          breakpoint is in the saved 6809  program  counter,  and  therefore
          using a space as the operand to a 'G' or 'S'  command  will  allow
          execution or single stepping to continue from the breakpoint.
             Breakpoints are entirely transparent, and will  remain  in  the
          program until explicitly removed.

    3. WARNINGS
    
          When executing breakpointed instruction, or when single  stepping,
       RAID copies the  instruction  into  it's  own  RAM  locations  before
       executing it. Because PC relative instruction depend  on  the  actual
       6809 program counter being at their address in the code, PC  relative
       instructions will not do proper addressing if they are  breakpointed,
       or single stepped.
    
          When RAID is invoked it attaches itself to the operating system in
       such a way that it becomes an essential part of the operating system.
       If for any reason RAID is terminated abnormally, it is  advisable  to
       reboot the operating system.
