    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          ASP is an assembly language source preprocessor, which allows  the
       programmer to uses expressions, and control structures from within an
       assembler program.
    
          ASP  reads  as  it's   input   an   ASP/Assembler   source   file,
       (Type='.ASP'), and produces as its output a standard  assembler  file
       (Type='.ASM') which can be assembled using the system assembler.
    
          ASP will produce extra code in the output  assembler  file,  which
       will perform  the  expressions  and  control  structures  which  were
       detected in the input file.
    
          The code generated by ASP  uses  ONLY  the  A  and  B  accumulator
       registers in the 6809, and will never  affect  the  index  registers,
       allowing them to be accessed completely by the program  code.  The  A
       and B accumultors may be modified  by  ASP  when  performing  certain
       functions, but will never be expected  to  contain  values  after  an
       assembler portion of the program is executed.
    
          For the execution of the 'IF / ELSE  /  END'  and  'WHILE  /  END'
       constructs, ASP will place labels in the output  file.  The  internal
       labels generated by ASP are always preceded by the '_' character,  to
       avoid conflicts with  assembler  code  labels.  Variable  names,  and
       statement labels are placed in the output file exactly  as  they  are
       spelled in the program, allowing the assembler code to access them.
    
          ASP  is  intended  to  simplify  the  control  structures   within
       assembler source programs, and as such, does not make great  attempts
       to produce efficent code. While entire programs can be written  using
       ASP statements, such an approach is bound to  produce  less  efficent
       code then when writing in proper assembler.

       1.1 ASP Control Statements
    
          1.1.1 ASM
    
                The ASM statement causes ASP to assume all  following  lines
             up to an 'END' statement are assembler source  statements,  and
             will copy them into the output file qithout change.
    
          1.1.2 BYTE <sym> [,<sym> ...]
                                       or
                  BYTE CONSTANT <sym>=<val> [,<sym>=<val> ...]
    
                BYTE defines 1 or more 8 bit storage location, which can  be
             refered to by the symbolic names specified. Each symbol will be
             assigned one byte of storage, unless it is followed by a number
             in braces EG: 'BYTE ABC(10 )' which causes the specified number
             of bytes to be reserved. (The space before the closing brace is
             nessary due to DOS call used to evaluate number).
                If the CONSTANT keyword is found, the sumbols  must  have  a
             value assigned to them, and will be EQUated to that value,  and
             not assigned a location in memory.
    
          1.1.3 CALL <label>
    
                Calls the subroutine indicated by the <label> parameter.
    
          1.1.4 CHAR <sym> [,<sym> ...]
                                       or
                   CHAR CONSTANT <sym>=<val> [,<sym>=val ...]
    
                CHAR is another name for BYTE, for readability purposes.
    
          1.1.5 CODE <address>
    
                Causes all subsequent code to  be  generated  following  the
             indicated address. <address> may be any valid operand  for  the
             assembler 'ORG' statement.
    
          1.1.6 DATA <address>
    
                Causes ASP to reserve data storage at the indicated address.
             If the program does not contain a DATA statement, ASP  reserves
             data storage at the address following the  last  byte  of  code
             produced.
    
          1.1.7 END
    
                End  terminates  one  of  'ASM',  'IF/ELSE',   'WHILE',   or
             'SUBROUTINE'.
    
          1.1.8 EXIT <expression>
    
                Exits to the DOS, with the return code  value  indicated  by
             <expression>.

          1.1.9 GOTO
    
                Produces a branch to the indicated label.
    
          1.1.10 IF <expr1>, <condition>, <expr2>
    
                Evaluates  the  expressions,  and  executes  the   following
             statements, only if the condition is satisfied. <condition> may
             be one of:
    
            'EQ' - <expr1> is equal to <expr2>.
            'NE' - <expr1> not equal to <expr2>.
            'LT' - <expr1> less than <expr2>.               (Signed)
            'GT' - <expr1> greated than <expr2>.            (Signed)
            'LE' - <expr1> less than or equal to <expr2>.   (Signed)
            'GE' - <expr1> greated than or equal to <expr2> (Signed)
            'LO' - <expr1> lower than <expr2>.              (Unsigned)
            'HI' - <expr1> higher than <expr2>.             (Unsigned)
            'LS' - <expr1> Lower or same as <expr2>.        (Unsigned)
            'HS' - <expr1> Higher or same as <expr2>.       (Unsigned)
    
                An 'ELSE' statement may follow an 'IF' statement, indicating
             a section of code to be executed only if the comparison  fails.
             The whole  IF/ELSE  structure  must  be  ended  with  an  'END'
             statement.
    
          1.1.11 INTEGER <sym> [,<sym> ...]
                                       or
                     INTEGER CONSTANT <sym>=<val> [, ... ]
    
                Defines one or more  16  bit  variables  or  constants,  the
             format is the same for the 'BYTE' statement.  If  the  optional
             size is given for a symbol, that indicates the number of 16 bit
             words of storage to reserve.
    
          1.1.12 SUBROUTINE
    
                Indicates the start of  a  subroutine,  a  label  should  be
             placed on the same line  as  the  'SUBROUTINE'  statement.  The
             subroutine must be terminated by an 'END' statement,  at  which
             time a 'RTS' instruction will be generated.
    
          1.1.13 WHILE <expr1> , <condition> , <expr2>
    
                Performs the next  block  of  statements  (Up  to  an  'END'
             statement), until the specified condition fails. The  condition
             may be any condition which is valid for the 'IF' statement. The
             condition is tested at the beginning of each loop.

       1.2 Assignments
    
             Whenever a statement is encountered which is  not  one  of  the
          preceding ASP control statements, ASP attempts to evaluate  it  as
          an expression, and to perform an assignment. The statement must be
          of the form:
                            <symbol> = <expression>
    
       1.3 Expressions
    
             Whenever ASP evaluates an expression, it parses the  expression
          from left to right, and generates code to  perform  the  indicated
          function. There is  no  operator  precedence,  ASP  generates  the
          expression code as soon  as  it  parses.  In  particular,  monadic
          operators ('>', '<', '++', '--', '-:') etc, operate  on  the  next
          immediate element in the expression only. precedence of operations
          may be forced using braces '()'.
    
    EG:      -:A+B   Complements A, then adds B.
             -:(A+B) Adds A and B, then Complements.
    
             The stack is used to hold temporary results,  when  multi-level
          or nested expressions are encountered.
    
             Expressions are evaluated as integers, unless a byte  value  is
          present as an element of the expression, in which code to evaluate
          byte operands is generated. ASP will access the lower  eight  bits
          of an integer is it is used within a BYTE oriented expression.
    
             The following operators are recognized by ASP:
    
               +            - Addition.
               -            - Subtraction.
               !            - Bitwise Logical OR.
               &            - Bitwise Logical AND.
               !!           - Bitwise Exclusive OR.
               ++           - Increment.            (One operand)
               --           - Decrement.            (One operand)
               -:           - Complement.           (One operand)
               >            - Shift right one.      (One operand)
               <            - Shift left one.       (One operand)
    
       1.4 Labels
    
             Labels may be placed on any ASP source statement line, and must
          be followed by a colon (':').
    
       1.5 Comments
    
             Any line beginning with a '*' in column number one, is  assumed
          to be a comment, and is ignored.

    2. QUALIFIERS
    
          The following qualifiers are recognized by the ASP command.
    
       2.1 /COMMENT
    
             Causes ASP to include comments  from  the  ASP  source  in  the
          assembler  output  file.  By  default,  comments  are  NOT  passed
          through.
    
       2.2 /QUIET
    
             Prevents ASP from displaying its startup and progress  messages
          as it runs.
    
       2.3 /SOURCE
    
             Causes ASP to include the ASP source  lines  in  the  assembler
          output as comments.

    3. SAMPLE PROGRAM
    
          The following is a  sample  ASP  program,  It  is  written  almost
       entirely using ASP statements. Although for  efficency  this  is  not
       normally  a  good  practice,  the  purpose  of  this  program  is  to
       demonstrate the capabilities of ASP.
