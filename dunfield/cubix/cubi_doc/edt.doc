    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          EDT is a fully featured, in-memory, text editor, for use under the
       CUBIX operating system. It operates in either a line by  line,  or  a
       visual screen format.
    
          In line by line mode, EDT assumes nothing about the terminal,  and
       displays all data in a "glass teletype" format.
    
          The visual screen format of EDT will work with most 24 line by  80
       character  ASCII  video  terminals,  and  uses  the  "TTY"   terminal
       interface library to achieve terminal independance.
    
          Consult the "TTY" manual for information on  using  "TTYPATCH"  to
       customize the control codes and function keys used by EDT.
    
    2. INVOKING EDT
    
          EDT is invoked with the command 'EDT  <filename>',  if  the  named
       file already exists, EDT will load and edit  it,  otherwise  a  blank
       file is presented.
    
          If the CURSOR POSITIONING string is defined (See "TTYPATCH"),  EDT
       will  automatically  enter  visual  mode,  clearing  the  screen  and
       displaying the first page of the file. Otherwise, EDT enters line  by
       line mode, and prompts for a command with '*'.
    
          The EDT which is distributed with the CUBIX system  has  no  "TTY"
       entries defined and will default to line mode operation.

    3. LINE MODE OPERATION
    
       3.1 Line ranges
    
             The line-range is an optional specification which controls  the
          range of lines for which the command has effect. Unless  otherwise
          stated, the default line-range assumed for  each  command  is  the
          "current" line (*).
    
             The "current" line is the line at which EDT  is  positioned  in
          line by line mode, and is also the line on  which  the  cursor  is
          positioned in visual mode.
    
             The following are the valid line range formats:
    
           *        - The "current" line
           /        - The entire file
           =        - The tagged lines
           0        - The end of the file
           <n>      - Line number <n>, (<n> >= 1)
           <r>,<r>  - Range between beginning of two other ranges.
    
             The '+' and '-' characters may be used to  add  or  subtract  a
          constant value from a line range.
    
                    eg: '0-12' <- 12 lines from end of file
    
             If '+' or '-' is used but no range is specified, an offset from
          the current line is assumed.
    
             The line range specification is entered immediately  preceeding
          the command name.
    
                         ie: '<r><command> <operands>'
    
       3.2 C - Copy text
    
             The 'C'opy command performs a  copy  of  the  active  range  of
          lines, placeing the copy directly ahead of the current line.
    
          Examples:
    
                    C               - Duplicate current line
                    1,10C           - Copy lines 1 to 10 inclusive
                    =C              - Copy tagged lines
    
       3.3 D - Delete text
    
             The 'D'elete command deletes the active range of lines.
    
          Examples:
    
                    D               - Delete current line
                    -5,+5D          - Delete 11 lines -5 to +5 from current
                    /D              - Delete entire file

       3.4 F - File information
    
             This command displays information about the file being  edited,
          includes  the  filename,  the  size  of  the  file  in  lines  and
          characters, and the size and position of the specified line range.
    
          Examples:
    
                    F               - Display file & current line information
                    =F              - Display file & tagged lines information
    
       3.5 I - Insert new text
    
             The 'I'nsert command prompts  for  'Input:',  and  inserts  all
          lines typed directly ahead of the active range. Enter a null  line
          to exit.
    
          Examples:
    
                    I               - Insert ahead of current line
                    /I              - Insert at start of file
                    0I              - Insert at end of file
    
       3.6 L - List text in simple form
    
             The 'L'ist command displays the  active  range  of  lines.  The
          display does not include  line  numbers  or  special  indications.
          'L'ist is faster and mode efficent that 'P'rint.
    
          Examples:
    
                    L               - List current line
                    /L              - List entire file
                    -10,+10L        - List 21 lines, centered on current
    
       3.7 M - Move text
    
             The 'M'ove command moves the  active  range  of  lines  to  the
          location directly ahead of the current line.
    
          Examples:
    
                    =M              - Move tagged lines
                    +1M             - Interchange active & next line
    
       3.8 P - Print text (Enhanced 'L'ist)
    
             The 'P'rint command displays the active range  of  lines.  This
          display includes the line  number  which  may  be  preceded  by  a
          special indication flag ('*' for  current  line,  '='  for  tagged
          lines).
    
          Examples:
    
                    P               - Display current line
                    /P              - Display entire file
    The EDT editor                                                   Page: 4


       3.9 Q - Quit (exit) editor
    
             The 'Q'uit command exits the  editor.  This  command  will  not
          allow an exit if unsaved changes are present in the file.
    
          Examples:
    
                    Q               - Quit editor
    
       3.10 QQ - Unconditional 'Q'uit
    
             The 'QQ'uit command exits the editor unconditionaly.
    
          Examples:
    
                    QQ              - Quit unconditionaly.
    
       3.11 R <filename> - Read file
    
             The 'R'ead command reads the entire contents of  the  specified
          file, and inserts it directly ahead of the active range.
    
          Examples:
    
                    Rabc            - Insert file 'abc' at current
                    /Rabc           - Insert file 'abc' at start
                    0Rabc           - Append file 'abc' at end
    
       3.12 S<dc><search><dc><replace> - Substitute
    
             The 'S'ubstitute command searches the active  range  of  lines,
          and replaces all occurrances  of  the  string  <search>  with  the
          string  <replace>.  The  <dc>  delimiter  character  may  be   any
          character not contained within the <search> string.
    
          Examples:
    
                    S'abc'def       - Change 'abc' to 'def' in current
                    /S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in entire file
    
       3.13 T - Tag lines
    
             The 'T'ag command tags the active range of lines, allowing them
          to be referred to by '=' in a subsequent command range.
    
          Examples:
    
                    T               - Tag current line
                    1,10T           - Tag lines 1 to 10
                    *,+5T           - Tag six lines starting at current

       3.14 V - Switch Visual Mode
    
             The 'V' command causes EDT to switch visual modes. This  enters
          visual mode if EDT was previously in line by line mode, and enters
          line by line mode if previously in visual mode.
    
          Examples:
    
                    V               - Switch visual modes
    
       3.15 W [filename] - Write to file
    
             The 'W' command writes the active range of lines to  the  named
          file, or to the original file edited if no name is specified.  Use
          of this command also resets the FILE CHANGED flag,  allowing  exit
          via 'q'.
    
             The default line range assumed for 'W'rite is the entire file.
    
          Examples:
    
                    W               - Write entire file
                    *W              - Write current line
                    Wabc            - Write entire file to 'abc'
                    =Wabc           - Write tagged lines to 'abc'
    
       3.16 X [filename] - Write file and eXit
    
             This command behaves exactly as the 'W'rite  command,  followed
          immediatly by a 'Q'uit command. It provides  a  shorthand  way  of
          saving your file and leaving the editor.
    
          Examples:
    
                    X               - Write file & exit
                    Xabc            - Write to 'abc' and exit
    
       3.17 ?<text> - Search for text
    
             The '?' command moves the active line to the first occurance of
          the specified string within the active range.
    
             The default range assumed for '?' is  one  character  past  the
          current cursor position (in visual mode) or the first character of
          the active line (In line by line mode), through to the end of  the
          file.
    
          Examples:
    
                    ?string         - Find next occurance of "string"
                    /?string        - Find first occurance of "string"

       3.18 $<command> - Execute CUBIX command
    
             The '$' command executes  the  specified  CUBIX  command.  Care
          should be taken to execute only internal  comands,  and  utilities
          which return via 'RTS' and do not overwite the EDT image in ram.
    
          Examples:
    
                    $files          - Execute 'files' command
    
       3.19 <no command> - Goto line
    
             If a line range is given without a command, EDT will reposition
          the "current" line to the beginning of that range.
    
          Examples:
    
                    100             - Move to line 100
                    /               - Move to start of file
                    0               - Move to end of file
                    =               - Move to tagged line(s)

    4. VISUAL MODE OPERATION
    
          When in VISUAL mode, EDT presents a window on the terminal  screen
       which displays the contents of a section of the file. Editing of  the
       file may be performed directly on the  screen  via  special  function
       keys, and the screen is updated so that you see your changes as  they
       are being performed.
    
       4.1 Entering text
    
             Text may be entered into  the  file  being  edited,  simply  by
          typeing it at the terminal keyboard. EDT automatically places  the
          text in the file, and  updates  the  screen  to  reflect  the  new
          contents. The  position  of  the  terminal  cursor  indicates  the
          position at which the text will be entered.
    
             The arrow keys on the terminal may be used to move  the  cursor
          around the displayed image.  Moveing  beyond  the  bottom  of  the
          screen causes EDT to scroll forward one line, and shift the screen
          up. Moveing beyond the top of the  screen  causes  EDT  to  scroll
          backward one half screen, and redisplay the text. If  the  end  of
          the file is within the area  shown  on  the  screen,  the  message
          '*EOF*' is displayed in special video.
    
       4.2 Visual mode function keys
    
             The following terminal keys must be defined  using  "TTYPATCH",
          and have special meaning to EDT:
    
          4.2.1 Right arrow
    
                Moves the cursor forward one character positon in the  file,
             if at the end of a line, the cursor will advance to  the  first
             position of the next line.
    
          4.2.2 Left arrow
    
                Moves the cursor backward one character positon in the file,
             if at the beginning of a line, the cursor will  backup  to  the
             last position of the previous line.
    
          4.2.3 Up arrow
    
                Moves the cursor up one line. If at the top of  the  screen,
             the display will scroll backwards by one half a screen page.
    
          4.2.4 Down arrow
    
                Moves the cursor down one line. If  at  the  bottom  of  the
             screen, the display will scroll forward by one line.
    The EDT editor                                                   Page: 8


                The cursor may appear to jump back and forth as it is  moved
             up and down, if it ancounters lines which are shorter than  the
             current character position within  the  line,  or  lines  which
             contain tabs. This is because whenever possible, the cursor  is
             returned to the same number of  physical  characters  from  the
             start of the line as is was on the first line from which the UP
             or DOWN arrow was pressed.
    
          4.2.5 Page up
    
                This key  pages  backward  one  screen.  (Top  line  becomes
             bottom)
    
          4.2.6 Page down
    
                This key pages forward one screen. (Bottom line becomes top)
    
          4.2.7 Page right
    
                Moves the cursor to the end of the line. If already  at  the
             end of a line, it is moved to the end of the next line.
    
          4.2.8 Page left
    
                Moves the cursor to the beginning of  the  line.  If  it  is
             already at the  beginning  of  a  line,  it  is  moved  to  the
             beginning of the previous line.
    
          4.2.9 Home
    
                This key moves the cursor to the beginning of the first line
             in the file.
    
          4.2.10 End
    
                This key moves the cursor to the end of the file.
    
          4.2.11 Delete character
    
                Deletes the character under the cursor, without  moving  the
             cursor.
    
          4.2.12 Delete previous
    
                Moves the cursor backward to the  previous  character,  then
             deletes that character.
    
          4.2.13 Clear screen
    
                Redraws the screen image of the file. This is normally  used
